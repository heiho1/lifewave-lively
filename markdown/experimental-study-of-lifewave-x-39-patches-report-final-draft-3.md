**Abstract**


LifeWave, Inc. has developed a new patch called X-39 which is proposed to be a


phototherapy product that stimulates the skin with specific wavelengths of light for


the purpose of elevating the peptide GHK-Cu. The peptide GHK-Cu may


effectively stimulate the natural healing process in the body. LifeWave, Inc. has


developed X-39 patch with numerous intended benefits like improvement in overall


energy, rapid relief from pain and improvement in overall functional vitality of the


body. A pilot study was conducted with forty experimental and five control


voluntary subjects who were studied before and after wearing the LifeWave, Inc.


X-39 patch for a period of six weeks, using cutting edge non-invasive screening


technologies like biofield imaging, electro photonic imaging and electro-interstitial


screening. This set of devices allowed us to extract a broad spectrum of data ranging


from physical, energetic and emotional aspects of the body non-invasively and


efficiently. Statistical analysis of data revealed a highly significant increase


(p<0.0001) in overall energy of subjects biofield and significant improvement


(p<0.05) in the symmetrical distribution of energy between the organs. Also, a


significant improvement (p<0.05) in green pixels after using the patches for 6 weeks


showed positive changes in the biofield of the subjects. Further research is required


with a larger population and a double-blinded placebo control group.

**LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patch**


The X-39 patch is a phototherapy product that stimulates the skin with specific


wavelengths of light for elevating the peptide GHK-Cu. Copper


tripeptide-1(GHK-Cu) is a small protein composed of the three amino acids


(protein building blocks) glycine, histidine, and lysine combined in a specific


geometric configuration with the physiologically beneficial mineral (copper)


(DeHaven, C., 2014). This tripeptide was first isolated from human plasma


albumin in 1973 by Dr Loren Pickart. Pickart noticed differences in the levels of


fibrinogen based on age. He additionally noticed that these differences stopped


when the older liver cells were incubated in blood from younger people. In 1977,


David Schlesinger of the Harvard University Chemistry Department confirmed


that the growth modulating peptide isolated by Pickart was a


glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine peptide. It is interesting to note that this peptide has


also been found in saliva, urine, and collagen. It is also important to mention that


none of the research around GHK has ever found it to cause any side effects.


(DeHaven, C., 2014). The copper tripeptide-1 belongs to a group of emergency


response molecules which are released during injury and come to the body’s aid


(DeHaven, C., 2014) It is naturally released by the body when there is any type of


injury to tissue. Research has identified that this peptide is used to signal the


beginning of the natural repair process. This benefit has specifically been


documented through research for post-laser or surgical wounds, ischemic, burns,


skin or hair transplants, and diabetic ulcers. Diabetic wounds healed three times


faster in the presence of Copper tripeptide-1. Time to re-epithelialization is


shortened (DeHaven, C., 2014). The copper tripeptide-1 has been suggested to


have a potential therapeutic role in age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive


decline. It improves axon survival and maintenance of nerves. (DeHaven, C.,


2014). The tripeptide has also been demonstrated to improve tissue remodelling. It


5



increases keratinocyte proliferation and normal collagen synthesis, improves skin


thickness, skin elasticity and firmness, improves wrinkles, photodamage and


uneven pigmentation, improves skin clarity, and tightens protective barrier


proteins (DeHaven, C., 2014). This has an impact on both scars and other effects


of damage to the skin, and natural ageing processes. The effects of tissue


remodelling also seem to have an impact on cancerous cells. The fact that GHK


was able to suppress 70% of genes involved in the development of an aggressive


metastatic form of colon cancer indicates that GHK is capable of the regulation of


various biochemical pathways on a gene level and it seems to be resetting the


gene activity back to health, which leads to the improvement of tissue repair.


(Pickart, L., 2012). GHK-Cu also has a demonstrated impact on other organs in


the body after they have been damaged. A collaborative study conducted by


scientists from Boston University, University of Groningen, University of British


Columbia, and University of Pennsylvania established that the GHK peptide


reverses the gene expression signature of COPD, which is manifested by


emphysema, inflammation, lung tissue destruction, and significant reduction of


lung capacity (Pickart, L., 2015). It is also important to note that the level of GHK


is about 200 ng/mL(10−7M) at age 20 but declines to 80 ng/mL by age 60


(Pickart, L., 2015). This likely explains the increasing impact on ageing. It would


also suggest that increased levels over time of GHK-Cu would have a positive


effect on both life expectancy and ageing.

The aim of the pilot study is to examine a number of claims for the product. Here


are common experiences people have with the X-39 patch:


   -  Improvement in energy


    -  Very deep sleep


    -  Rapid pain relief


    -  Rapid recovery from exercise


   -  Improved sports performance


    -  Improved cognitive function


    -  Improved libido


   -  Accelerated wound healing


    -  Healing of old injuries


    -  Tightening of the skin


**Devices used**


**Multiscan Pro**


**Technologies and functions (theoretical basis):**


**Galvanic skin response and sudomotor function**


The Galvanic skin response device measures the electrical conductance of the skin,


from the sweat glands. The sudomotor sweat glands are controlled by the


sympathetic nervous system. The GSR evaluates the sweat gland response (sweat


rate) to electrical stimulation. The response is related to the sympathetic system and


sudomotor level activity. Sudomotor test gives skin blood flow and C fiber


density.GSR is a measurement of 11 pathways of the body using 6 electrodes from


anode to cathode and cathode to anode. Send current through electrode, through


interstitial fluid of body pathway, then exits and makes stimulation of cholinergic


fiber of the sweat gland and release of norepinephrine, the sweat gland releases


7


sweat, the sweat goes to the electrode and you have conductance proportional to the


sweat. The impedance signal travels through sweat glands so placement of


electrodes important (areas with more sweat glands) DC cannot go through the cell


or through the vascular, only interstitial fluid (ISF). Two measurements are taken


for 11 pathways, 22 total measurements are then applied to Fast Fourier Transform


(same math formula applied for HRV) and have 3 frequencies corresponding to the


variability of the conductance. Sudomotor analysis measures the sweat rate response


to electrical stimulation. The response is estimated from the conductance values


measured between different pairs of metal electrodes. The sweat rate response is


measured in Conductance values expressed in micro Si (microSiemens) units. Fig. 1


shows the mechanism of sudomotor function and galvanic skin response.


**Fig.1** Sudomotor function and galvanic skin response


**Bioelectric impedance measurements**


Bioelectric impedance measurements (BIM) represents a wide range of old and new


non-invasive technologies and methods, where a very small electric current is


applied to the body via one or more surface electrode and the resultant current


passing through the body, is detected at other surface electrodes placed elsewhere


on the body. A drop in voltage occurs as the current encounters impedance or


8


resistance inherent in the fluids and tissues it passes through as it courses through


the various physiological “compartments” of the body. These compartments include


the bloodstream, the intracellular space, the lymphatic system, the interstitial space,


and others. This drop in voltage provides indirect information about the physical


and chemical properties of the compartment(s) that the current passes through.


Multiscan pro is a programmable electro-medical system, which is scientifically


proven and clinically validated as an efficient and non-invasive medical device that


measures physiological parameters and produces detail reports with 89 % repeatable


accuracy. It measures the conductivity of interstitial fluid between the cells. The


bioimpedance technology is very similar to ECG and EEG, but instead of supplying


information for brain or heart only, Multiscan pro measures electro-physiological


properties of 22 different volumes within the body and produces data for 69


different physiological parameters. Successive measurements are made with weak


current low frequency (700 Hz) between six tactile electrodes placed symmetrically


on the forehead, hands, and feet of the subject. Each electrode is alternatively


cathode and anode (bipolar mode from the anode to cathode), which permits the


recording of the resistance (Law of Ohm) of 22 segments of the human body. The


weak current with low frequency (700 Hz) specifically passes through the interstitial


fluid compartment. The interstitial fluid (or tissue fluid) compartment represents


approximately 16% of the body’s total water. Interstitial fluid is extracellular water


and solutes surrounding cells but is located outside the bloodstream and lymphatic


system. Interstitial fluid forms the microscopic interface between cells and


capillaries and presents a specific biochemical composition and a low protein


concentration.


In one second, each of the body’s 22 segments is measured 32 times with a Start


Point Average (SPA) and an End Point Average (EPA). Therefore, the total data is


704 pulses per measurement. The measured resistances are transmitted with a


9


numeric form for each segment, to an informative program. The EPA resistance


values are converted to conductivity (C = 1/R), incorporated in a graph of the


conductivity of the 22 segments called an Electro Scan Gram (ESG)​. The ESG was


​
converted to the second derivative ESG (SD ESG) graph displayed in Fig. 3. The


mathematical calculation of the standard deviation of the conductivities (SDC) is


related to the tissue fluid Na+ concentration, according to the Electrode Polarization


Impedance (EPI) technique.

**Fig. 3** SD ESG graph showing the average value of the 22 segments of the ESG graph at point 0


on a​ scale of -100/+100 (KOhm, μA, and μSiemens).


The difference between EPA and SPA is the electrical dispersion of the current into


the tissue. It corresponds to the morphology of the interstitial fluid and increases in


cases of swelling from the cells or from the blood vessel. Therefore:


EPA –SPA = Interstitial Fluid Volume (IFV)


Elevated IFV is found in cases of ischemia/hypoxia, acute inflammation and tissue


destruction. Low IFV occurs in cases of cells growth or relative tissue density


increased (swelling). A SpO2 monitor is placed on the fingertip to detect changes in


heart rate, oxygen levels, as well as, cardiac output. Fig. 2 shows the Wellness


Score which is a composite score derived from the Arterial assessment, ANS


assessment and Lifestyle assessment scores which includes Lifestyle and Body


Composition scores. Fig. 4 shows the extended ANS assessment (Sympathetic /


Parasympathetic systems) window.

**Bio-Well (EPI\GDV)**


Bio-Well is a revolutionary tool based on Electro-Photonic Imaging and Gas


Discharge Visualization technique (Kirlian effect) made especially for


express-assessment of the emotional and energetic state of a person. The Bio-Well


is developed by Dr Konstantin Korotkov. An electric impulse stimulates a


biological subject and generates a response of the subject in the form of photon &


electron emission. The glow of the photon radiation owing to the gas discharge


generated in the electromagnetic field is transformed by an optical & charge coupled


​
device systems into a computer file. Subjects were required to put each fingertip on


a quartz plate and an image displaying the photons emissions is then analyzed. GDV


Technique is the computer registration and analysis of electro-photonic emissions of


different objects, including biological (specifically the human fingers) resulting


12


from placing the object in the high-intensity electromagnetic field on the device


lens.When a scan is conducted, a weak electrical current is applied to the fingertips


for less than a millisecond. The subject's response to this stimulus is the formation


of a variation of an "electron cloud" composed of light energy photons. The


electronic "glow" of this discharge is captured by the camera system and then


translated and transmitted back in graphical representations.

various systems of the body by Bio-Well software as shown in Fig. 6. For this


study, the energy, organ balance and L\R symmetry of the aura were analyzed for


balance and vibrancy.

**Biofield Viewer (BV)**


Biofield Viewer 3.5 (BV) is an advanced imaging technology that reveals light


interference patterns on and below the skin’s surface. The Biofield Viewer software


combined with the controlled imaging environment allows for visualization of the


light photon interactions between the light source and the human biofield. The


Biofield Viewer program compares the reflected rays with the incident rays and


then re-codes them and produces a biofield image. The system identifies the


intensity of light within the image and then gives the photons a designated number


relating to colour in the visible spectrum. Thus it is a digital encoding system and


the smallest differences in the density of photons is recorded and viewed on a


computer screen using colour coding. Light striking the physical body may be


reflected or absorbed. The various intensities of light differ on and around the body


and Biofield Viewer allow these differences to be seen. The participant is exposed


15


to a standardized lighting environment and should be disrobed with all jewellery


removed to maximize skin exposure and minimize image artefacts. **​** A white, matte


wall provides a monochromatic background against which the BV colours are most


clearly highlighted. A digital camera is used to detect the interference of biophotons


emanating from the subject with the light produced from the standardized lighting


system. The BV software measures the absorption and reflection of light on the


skin’s surface and surroundings then display a composite image of the accentuated


interference gradations on the screen. The second set of biofield images are placed


through a filtering software the Chakra Viewer application of the software


introduces filters which smooth the data sets into distinct bandings. This process


allows for a closer investigation of the chakras and emotional aspect of the biofield.


The Chakra Viewer is being widely used in research to monitor the effect of


investigation of these images broadens the scope of understanding of emotional,


psychological, and spiritual well being. The system reveals homeostasis in the


biofield, and the Chakra Viewer now reveals the chakra live and in colour. In


analyzing a Chakra Viewer image, the functionality of the energy centres can be


monitored. Much research has been conducted on the relationship between the


endocrine glands and the chakras, as well as, the new branch of science entitled


psycho-neuro-immunology.

**Methodology**


The study was funded by LifeWave, Inc. with a small grant and done under the


approval by Royal Pune independent ethics committee(RIPEC). Forty-five subjects


aged between 40 to 65 years were randomly selected through word of mouth to take


part in the study of the efficacy of LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patches, Out of which forty


subjects were in the experimental group and five subjects served as control group.


The data collection was done in three phases starting with the baseline on the day


before the subject start wearing the patches, seconds set of scans were taken after 3


weeks and the final scans were done after 6 weeks from the baseline scan date. The


primary data collections were done at Holistic care and cure ayurvedic clinic,


Bangalore, Karnataka under the supervision of Dr Thornton Streeter and Dr


Rachana Ghatol-Shetty. A member of the research team verbally explained the


​
study and gave subjects the Informed Consent Form (ICF). Only persons who


signed the ICF were be allowed to participate in the study. Six weeks supply of


LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patches were given to the subjects in the experimental group.


The subjects were instructed to stick the LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patches at the base of


the back of the neck where C7 vertebrae protrude as shown in the Fig. 8. The


subjects were instructed to wear a new patch every day for 12 hours during the


daytime for 6 weeks. All the subjects were given an identification number to allow


for protection of confidential information collected throughout the study.

**Biofield Viewer (BV)**


The subjects were scanned before receiving the patch which serves as a baseline.


Further images were taken at the end of the first three weeks and then at the end of


six weeks. A white LED light array is used as the primary light source and the


subjects were asked to stand against a plain white background, the image of the


subjects were taken in the chakra viewer mode of the Biofield Viewer software 3.5.


Pixel analysis of BV scans was done using Fiji (ImageJ) to measure red, blue and


green pixels. The red pixels represent pooled or low energy. Green pixels stands for


vital energy.


**Bio-well (EPI\GDV)**


The first baseline scans were taken before the subjects start using the LifeWave, Inc.


X-39 and given a six week supply of the patches. The next scans were taken at the


end of 3 weeks and 6 weeks. The subjects have to place all ten fingers on top of a


quartz glass plate inside the bio-well device which captures the image of all ten


fingers. The data is recorded is analysed by the Bio-Well 5.8.0.0 professional


software. The results were compared to the baseline see the improvement in overall


energy of the body, organ balance, L/R symmetry distribution of energy.


**Multiscan Pro (MSP)**


The initial full body assessment data will be collected in Multiscan Pro before the


study to fix a baseline for comparing the data to find the improvements in the body


after applying X-39 patch. Multiscan pro will record the Heart Rate Variability,


Sudomotor function, Galvanic skin response, Digital wave pulse analysis,


Bioimpedance and total body composition. The wellness score, vascular age and the


Phase angle are the parameters considered for this study. Wellness score is a


composite score derived from the Arterial assessment, ANS assessment and


Lifestyle assessment scores which includes Lifestyle and Body composition score.


Vascular Age provides a measure of the apparent age of the arteries when compared


18


with healthy people. Phase angle is the measurement of the capacitance of living


cells when stimulated by 50-kilohertz alternating current(AC) causing a lag between


potential and current. The value of Phase angle is directly proportional to the


cellular health. The Multiscan Pro starts its procedure when the subjects place their


hands and legs on the metal plate and four electrodes are connected to the forehead


of the subject as shown in Fig. 9


**Fig. 9** Multiscan Pro for head electrodes and tetrapolar stainless steel plates for hands and legs.


The Multiscan Pro has four stages in data collection which are as follows,


1. Baseline recording: The baseline recording will take 120 seconds to complete its


procedure.


2. Valsalva test: The subjects have to take a deep breath close both the nostrils with


their right hand and hold it for 15 seconds and slowly exhale for 5 seconds and


place their right-hand palm upside down for the next 40 seconds.


3. Deep breathing test: The subject has to slowly inhale for 5 seconds and exhale for


5 seconds this cycle has to be done 6 times for 60 seconds.


4. Orthostatic test: The subjects have to step down from tetrapolar plates for the legs


and stand on the floor, keeping their hands on the plates for 60 seconds.

**Discussion**



Table.2 Results of the subjects in control group



The pilot study demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the subjects


biofield from using the LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patches in Bio-Well (EPI\GDV) and


Biofield Viewer (BV). The statistical analysis revealed a highly significant


improvement (p<0.0001) in overall energy of the person and significant


improvement(p<0.05) in the symmetrical distribution of energy over different


organs in bio-well (EPI\GDV). A significant improvement (p<0.05) of green pixels


in BV pixel analysis supports the effectiveness of the X-39 patches in terms of


improving the vitality of the biofield. Table. 1 displays summary post-test statistics


for the changes in the experimental group and reports the significance level. Table.


2 displays summary post-test statistics of the subjects in the control group have not


got a statistical significance.


From this research, we can conclude that LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patch is effective in


elevating the overall energetic vitality of the biofield and the body and also boosting


the self-healing mechanisms. This study reveals the potential of X-39 patches to


provide sustainable non-drug therapy. Several anecdotal responses were heard from


the subjects that the patches helped them to have an active day and sound sleep in


the night. Smart interventions are increasing in popularity, due to drug toxicity and


27


side effects. Patches can provide a sustainable complement to conventional


therapies. This study was conducted without a placebo patch. To advance this


science, future studies must be undertaken with a larger random sample using


double-blinded placebo controlled trials.


**Conclusion**


The pilot study demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the


experimental group when compared to the control group. It can be concluded that


X-39 patches are effective in bringing positive changes in the biofield and


improving the overall wellness of a person.
