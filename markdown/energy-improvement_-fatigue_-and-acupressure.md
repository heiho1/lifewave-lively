OBJECTIVE: To search for an effective therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).
METHODS: Eighty-five cases of CFS were treated with massage and pressing of Backshu points, combined with pressing acupoints on the head. The therapeutic effect was
observed. RESULTS: After treatment of 3 courses, 26 cases were markedly effective,
52 cases were effective, and 7 cases were ineffective, with a total effective rate of 91.8%
and a markedly effective rate of 30.6%. CONCLUSION: Pressing acupoints and
massage **can effectively improve clinical symptoms of the patient with chronic**
**fatigue** syndrome.

Fatigue and depressive mood are the most significant symptoms experienced by patients with
end-stage renal disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of
acupressure with massage in fatigue and depression in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) receiving hemodialysis treatment. The study applied an experimental pretest and posttest
design. Sixty-two hemodialysis patients participated in the study. Data were collected from two
hemodialysis clinics in major hospitals in southern Taiwan. Following consent to the study,
subjects were randomly assigned to an acupressure group or a control group. Patients in the
acupressure group received acupoint massage for 12 minutes per day, three days per week, for
four weeks. Subjects in the control group only received routine unit care. The measures included
the Revised Piper Fatigue Scale, and Beck ' s Depression Inventory. Descriptive statistics, chi 2
tests, t-test and analyses of covariance were used for data analysis. The results indicate that
subjects experienced a moderate level of fatigue. Nearly 65 % of hemodialysis patients had a
depressed mood. ANCOVA results indicated that fatigue (F((1.54)) = 9.05, p =.004) and
depression (F((1.54)) = 4.20, p =.045) among patients in the acupressure group showed
significantly greater improvement than patients in the control group. The findings of this study
provide an interventional model for nurses taking care of ESRD patients.

The purpose of the study is to investigate the **effectiveness of acupressure on fatigue**
in patients with end-stage renal-disease (ESRD). The study was a randomized control
trial; qualified patients were randomly assigned into acupressure group, sham group or
control group. A total of 106 participants were included in the study. The measures
included the revised Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), VAS of Fatigue, the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index and the Beck Depression Inventory. Data of fatigue measures were
collected at pretreatment and a week following treatment. Sleep quality and depression
were collected during post-test only. The statistical methods included the descriptive
statistics, one-way ANOVA, ANCOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA. ANCOVA
that adjusted for differences in baseline fatigue scores (PFS), post-test of depression and
sleep quality, result was significant, F(2,100)=3.99, p=0.02. Post-hoc tests revealed that
patients in the acupressure group were significantly having lower scores of fatigue than
patients in the control group. ANCOVA results also significant for VAS of Fatigue
among groups, F(2,100)=5.63, p=0.003. Comparisons indicated that there were
significant differences between the acupressure group and the control group (p=0.01)
and between the sham group and control group (p=0.003). Predialysis fatigue was
assessed routinely by using a rating of 0-10. Repeated-measures ANOVA results
demonstrate the group main effect was significant in the perceived fatigue
(F(2,88)=19.46, p<0.001). Follow-up tests indicated there were significant differences
between the acupressure group and the control group (p<0.001) and between the sham
group and control group (p<0.001).The study provided an alternative method for health
care providers to managing ESRD patients with fatigue.
