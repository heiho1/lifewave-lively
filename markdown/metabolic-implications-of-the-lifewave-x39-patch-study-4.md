**Introduction**

This study explores the metabolic implications and physiologic results of wearing


the Lifewave X39 patch over a one week period of time. Measures were taken at


baseline/Day 1, Day 2 and at 1 Week of wearing the patch. 15 subjects were selected to


participate in this study using a sample of convenience. This was made up of both men


and women aged 40-65.


**Background**


The Lifewave X39 patch focuses on stimulating the copper tripeptide GHK- Cu.


“Copper tripeptide-1(GHK-Cu) is a small protein composed of the three amino acids


(protein building blocks) glycine, histidine, and lysine combined in a specific geometric


configuration with the physiologically beneficial mineral (copper)” (DeHaven, C., 2014).


This tripeptide was first discovered by Dr. Loren Pickart in 1973, when he isolated it


from human plasma albumin. Pickart, noticed differences in the levels of fibrinogen


based on age. He additionally noticed that these differences stopped when the older liver


cells were incubated in blood from younger individuals. “In 1977, David Schlesinger of


the Harvard University Chemistry Department confirmed that the growth modulating


peptide isolated by Pickart was a glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine peptide.” It is interesting to


note that this peptide has also been found in saliva, urine, and collagen. Later research


also established that GHK has two forms, GHK alone and GHK-CU, in which the GHK


peptide has bound with copper due to the strong affinity the GHK peptide has for it. It is


also of note that none of the research around GHK has ever found it to cause a negative


side effect. (DeHaven, C., 2014)


The “copper tripeptide-1 belongs to a group of emergency response molecules


which are released during injury and come to the body’s aid...” (DeHaven, C., 2014) It is


naturally released by the body when there is any type of injury to tissue. Research has


identified that the peptide is used to signal the beginning of the natural repair process.


This benefit has specifically been documented through research for post-laser or surgical


wounds, ischemic, burns, skin or hair transplants, and diabetic ulcers. “Diabetic wounds


healed three times faster in the presence of Copper tripeptide-1. Time to re

epithelialization is shortened.” (DeHaven, C., 2014) The “copper tripeptide-1 has been


suggested to have a potential therapeutic role in age-related neurodegeneration and


cognitive decline. It improves axon survival and maintenance of nerves.” (DeHaven, C.,


2014)


The tripeptide has also been shown to improve skin repair. “It increases


keratinocyte proliferation and normal collagen synthesis, improves skin thickness, skin


elasticity and firmness, improves wrinkles, photodamage and uneven pigmentation,


improves skin clarity, and tightens protective barrier proteins.” (DeHaven, C., 2014) This


has an impact on both scars and other effects of damage to the skin, and natural aging


processes. The effects of tissue remodeling also appear to have an impact on cancerous


cells. “The fact that GHK was able to suppress 70% of genes involved in the


development of an aggressive metastatic form of colon cancer indicates that GHK is


capable of the regulation of various biochemical pathways on a gene level and it seems to


be resetting the gene activity back to health, which leads to the improvement of tissue


repair.” (Pickart, L., 2015)


GHK-Cu also has a demonstrated impact on other organs in the body after they


have been damaged. “A collaborative study conducted by scientists from Boston


University, University of Groningen, University of British Columbia, and University of


Pennsylvania established that the GHK peptide reverses the gene expression signature of


COPD, which is manifested by emphysema, inflammation, lung tissue destruction, and


significant reduction of lung capacity.” (Pickart, L., 2015) It is also important to note


that “…the level of GHK is about 200 ng/mL(10−7M) at age 20, but declines to 80


ng/mL by age 60.” (Pickart, L., 2015) This likely explains the increasing effects of aging.


It would also suggest that increased levels over time of GHK-Cu would have a positive


effect on both life expectancy and aging.


**Non-transdermal Patch**


The X39 patches are sealed so that nothing in the patch will penetrate the skin.


This produces consistent promotion of the light flow throughout the time the patch is


worn. In this study the initial baseline readings were taken, and then the X39 patch was


applied. The participant was asked to wear the patch 12 hours each day. The participant


removed the patch at night and a fresh patch was applied each morning prior to 8 am.


The patch was worn for a minimum of 1 hour before the additional data measures were


taken. Patches were worn for a total of 7 days. Data taking with the patch applied was


done on day one, day two and day seven.


**Phototherapy**


Phototherapy has been defined as “the use of ultraviolet (UV) light for its healing


effects.” (Kakimoto, C., 2017) Supported by normal electro-dermal skin conductance


(Becker, (1985), Flick, (2004)), the human body gives off a number of materials


biochemically including particulate release, gas emission, ultraviolet light, near infrared


light, and visible spectrum light. The Lifewave patches have been specifically developed


to reflect this light back onto the skin where the patch has been placed. This then


stimulates the area of skin, producing improved physiological effects. Variations on


phototherapy have been used for at least 100 years. In that time there has not been much


evidence of negative side effects, though there is a concern about a potential increase in


cancer rates. It is currently largely theoretical, and “there was no significant association


found with basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma.” (Kakimoto, C.,


2017) This suggests that phototherapy represents a relatively unexplored option for


healing with reasonably few risks.


**Meridian Implications and Patch placement**


Specific meridian points are chosen for the placement of the Lifewave patches to


maximize effectiveness. The Chinese meridian system is over 3000 years old, with


current information mapping the meridian system to parts of the lymphatic system. Two


points were specifically chosen for the X39 patch. The first is GV14, Du-14, or Tao Dao,


which is a point on the back, and the second is CV-6, Ren 6, or Qi Hai, which is a point


on the lower abdomen. (Deadman, P., 2001)


This study focused on the metabolic impact of patch usage, with half the


participants using the CV6 point and half using the GV14 point.


**Metabolic Suite**


For the purposes of this study the Sabre Sciences HPA2 metabolic suite has been


selected. The HPA 2 Profile includes both urine and saliva collection. The urine


evaluates: 5-HTP, Serotonin, Dopamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, GABA,


Glutamate, Histamine, L-DOPA, Normetanephrine, Metanephrine, and 3

Methoxytyramine. The saliva evaluates: Cortisol and DHEA. Several additional measures


have been added to the HPA2 suite, Glutathione, and a cysteine to cystine ratio will also


be tested using the urine sample. Three measures will be taken: baseline, 24 hours and


7days. (Sabre Sciences Laboratory, http://www.sabresciences.com/):


Metabolic testing consisted of one 10am urine taken at baseline/day one, day two


and day seven. Saliva Testing consisted of a six swabs taken in one day at baseline/day


one, day two and seven. Subjects self-administered the swab under the supervision of Dr.


Connor when in the laboratory, which was then placed back in the shipping container and


labeled with the subject number. Samples were kept in the freezer at -20F and were


shipped with ice by UPS to the Sabre Science lab in Carlsbad, CA on a daily basis.


**Physiology Suite**

All study participants had the following physiological testing done at base line, 24


hours and 7 days: Six minute recordings of EKG, pulse, respiration, heart rate variability


(HRV), temp, blood volume pulse, galvanic skin response, and 2 EMG (muscle) leads


(one on each shoulder area). At baseline testing, participants were checked for any


allergic reactions to the adhesive patches. Allergic reactions to physiological test patches


happen at a rate of 1:100,000 and if an allergic reaction was discovered participants


would be referred to the local urgent care for treatment and then dropped from the study.


No participants in this study had an adverse event of any type. Fresh adhesive patches


were used for each person tested. Adhesive patches are disposed of in bio hazard


containers after use.


**Questionnaires**

A series of questionnaires were administered to support the metabolic findings.


_**Marlowe Crowne**_

The Marlowe Crowne is a 13 Item true/false short form that is a measure of


subjects’ tendencies to give answers that they may perceive are desired by the interviewer


and/or reflect perceived positive social norms. This variable can produce inaccurate or


misleading findings unless properly controlled for in statistical analysis. Estimated


completion time 2 minutes. This instrument was normed by Reynolds in 1982.


_**McGill Pain Scale**_


This scale is comprised of three sections regarding a subject’s pain. Section


number one asks, “What Does Your Pain Feel Like?” and then lists 20 descriptive


categories that are numerically rated as 1 – 5. Section number two asks, “How Does Your


Pain Change with Time?” The first question asks the subject to describe the pattern of


their pain; and this is followed by 22 descriptive terms regarding their effects on


increasing or decreasing pain. The third section reflects upon the strength of the pain and


has six questions that give a context and comparison to the current pain compared to


other types of pain suffered in the past. Again this section is ranked numerically 1-5, with


one being mild and five being excruciating. (Melzack, R., 1975)


_**Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index**_


This scale is comprised of a mix of quantitative questions and five likert scale


questions 0-3. It explores the type and quality of sleep experienced by an individual over


the past month. It was normed by Cole et al. (2006).


_**Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale, Visual Analogue Scale (AIOS-VAS)**_


_**for Vitality**_


The AIOS- VAS rates subject’s “overall sense of well-being and vitality” over the


past 24 hours, using a 100mm one-line visual analogue scale. This instrument was


normed by Bell in 2004.


_**Profile of Mood States (POMS)**_


The POMS is a 37-item 5 factor scale which is a basic measure of affective state


in several dimensions including vigor, mood, anxiety and depression. 8 minutes


maximum completion time. It was normed by McNair et al., 1971/1981; Shacham, 1983.


_**WAS III**_


A subsection of the WAS III will be used to determine level of short and long


term memory and if there is an improvement in memory from baseline to 7 days.


**Statistical Analysis**


Data from questionnaires were collected on standard answer sheets and scored. Then the


data points were entered into an excel spread sheet for statistical evaluation. Standardized tests


were scored and reviewed for data trends and significant results. All questionnaires parameters


were summarized in terms of means and standard deviation, stratified by assessment time point.


Changes between assessment time points were evaluated using a paired t-test or nonparametric


Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. All physiology parameters were summarized in terms of means and


standard deviation, stratified and across the 6 study epochs. Changes from pre-to post patch


administration were evaluated using a paired t-test. Normal probability plots were examined to


verify the distribution assumptions. All reported P-values are two-sided and PFemaleMale|10 (67%)5 (33%)|
|Age (yrs), means ±SD|61.9 ± 9.3|


A sample of convenience of individuals who responded to locally placed flyers


consisted of 15 individuals. There were five men and 10 women in the study which had a


mean age of 61.9 ± 9.3 years.

The Marlowe-Crowne looks at social desirability. It is used to measure the


reliability of the data. One common confounding variable in research is research subjects


telling the researchers the answers they think the researchers want. The middle range that


is being shown here suggests that this was not an issue with this particular group. It is


also interesting that this group had a non-significant negative mean change, indicating


that the responders became more honest.

The AIOS-VAS looks at the overall wellness of an individual. In this case there


was a clear, though not quite significant shift established by the second day of testing. It


had increased to significance by day 7 showing clear overall improvement in the feelings


of vitality and wellness.

Memory is a common issue for people above age 45. The WAIS III is a well


established intelligence test which includes a standard memory test. There was a clear,


though not significant, improvement in short term memory by day 7. It is likely that this


would get more significant with a larger group of people and a longer intervention period.


It is also interesting that there was improvement in both mid and long term memory as


well, though to a much lower degree. Further research should be done in this specific area


as a non-invasive support to memory as one ages has the potential to be of benefit to


many individuals.

The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index was used to look at sleep, which is also a


common issue once people get past 45. This questionnaire showed an immediate strong


shift the first night, though it was not quite significant. The shift by day 7 was significant.


This is particularly important as sleep strongly effects everything else related to health


and wellbeing.


There were no significant changes in the Profile of Mood States and the McGill


Pain scores from the baseline (pre-patch) assessment to close of study.

Amino acids and neurotransmitters play a critical role in the health and wellbeing


of individuals. If an individual’s amino acid and neurotransmitter production is broken,


the individual cannot maintain body health for long. The number of statistically


significant changes demonstrated in this study shows the powerful impact which can be


created by the use of phototherapy products and the clear positive changes produced by


the application of this specific non-transdermal Lifewave product X-39. Key findings are


Glutamate and Histamine as they show a distinct anti-inflammatory trend produced by


the patch.


Of note the amino acids Glycine and Glutamate, which are used in the process to


form Glutathione in a transsulfuration pathway, both showed a drop off at a level of


significance. This is very important. Gluthione is part of the body system which supports


reduction of inflammation pathways in a unique aspect. It specifically acts from the liver


to detoxify the blood. So for example, it clears heavy metals from the body rather than


acting as an anti-inflammatory agent directly. A decrease in the materials that produce the


glutathione as the result of patch usage means that more glutathione is being made. This


results in higher availability of the glutathione in the blood and allows the body to clear


more damaging material faster. This supports the overall reduction in inflammation


which was demonstrated in the data results.

Reduction in blood pressure and improved muscle relaxation are consistent changes


which are present in the physiology data. Greater flexibility in HRV in the over age 60


population is an important finding.


**Discussion**


It should be remembered that this was both a sample of convenience and a 1 week


study with a sample size of 15 subjects. However, there are several areas that showed


significant change, as well as a few that showed a clear tendency to change, though not


quite to the level of significance. It should also be noted that the shift in sleep is


especially interesting given that the research subjects sleep was being interrupted every


four hours for the saliva testing on the days those questionnaires were administered. This


means that the results may have been stronger without the confounding variable. The lack


of shift in POM, which looks at overall mood, is also interesting. The patch itself was not


expected to shift the research subjects’ mood, but there was a possibility of it being a


secondary effect. Improved sleep and energy often improve people’s mood.


There are several key pieces of information in this data. The first is the


improvement in blood pressure. For a non-invasive process like photo-therapy in


comparison with the challenging side-effects caused by most blood pressure medications


and a more vulnerable population with those who are aging, further exploration of this


parameter should be a priority.


The second is the impact of the metabolic changes shown in amino acid


production. While amino acid production and metabolism changes on a daily basis and is


strongly impacted by what foods we eat and our daily activities, the data taken over


several days gives a snap-shot of change. Key findings are Glutathione and Histamine


results as they show a distinct anti-inflammatory trend produced by the patch. This is


further confirmed when looking at Glycine and Glutamate in combination. They are used


in the metabolic processes to form Glutathione through the transsulfuration pathway.


Since both showed a drop off at a level of significance it shows that they are being used


for the purpose of the production of Glutathione. This is very important. Gluthione is part


of the body system which supports reduction of inflammation pathways in a unique


aspect. It specifically acts from the liver to detoxify the blood.


In addition, the third finding shows that flexibility in the gut systems may be able


to be restored. As one ages there is often less flexibility in all the body systems.


Flexibility is key in human survival. We must be able to adapt moment to moment in


order to survive. This patch triggers change in the gut and what may be determined in


studies of longer duration to be restoring fitness and adaptability to change. It is


important to note as the fourth finding that changes were in most of the types of amino


acids and not limited to a single type of amino acid. We saw changes in essential, non

essential, branched chain essential, aromatic and non- proteinogenic amino acids instead


of a single amino acid or area of amino acid production.


The fifth interesting finding is the almost as significant (0.08) improved short


term memory within a week. Memory loss in aging is a significant issue around the


world. Longer studies of larger size which explore the impact of this phototherapy


product should be explored.


**Summary**

This study explored the metabolic and physiologic aspects of the Lifewave X39


patch. In addition, questionnaires which were administered concurrently cover a range of


previously reported experiences with the X39 patches. These include quality of sleep


improvement, memory improvement, feelings of vitality, reduction of pain and


inflammation, and an overall sense of well-being. This study provides a short term


picture of the lived experience of participants who are wearing the Lifewave X39 patch.


The data results of improvement in blood pressure, 17 statistically significant


amino acid changes over the 7 days, significant improvement in anti-inflammatory


response, improvement in sleep levels, reduction in blood pressure, improvement in short


term memory, improvement in reported feelings of vitality and consistency in reporting


across the study suggest that further research with a larger sample size be done and


confirm the previously reported anecdotal responses in the testing of earlier subjects.


Since this study was done on an aging population it is also important to note that


the patch appears to support the movement back toward fitness of the gut system and


improved adaptability to change. The human body must live on the edge of chaos so that


it can adapt and respond to change moment to moment in order to survive. One of the


first areas of the body that shows a lack of adequate responsiveness to change as we age


is the gut. While this is only a one week period, the oscillatory effect shown in the data


over the three samples taken during that period on each subject, show improved response


promoting fitness and adaptability to change. If one can change in response to the


environment, one can survive longer. Combined with the anti-inflammatory response


shown in this data, there is a potential for impact on longevity. Further longitudinal


studies need to be undertaken to determine if these effects are maintained or improved


over time.


The Lifewave X39 patch shows clear, significant metabolic, blood pressure,


memory improvement, sleep and other changes over the course of one week which


should be explored over longer periods of time in future studies so that a better


understanding of the comprehensive nature and effects of the phototherapy produced by


this patch may be demonstrated.

Table 1: Summary statistics for metabolic markers, stratified by assessment time point ........................ 43

Table 2: Change from time 1 to time 2, time 2 to time 3 and time 1 to time 3 ......................................... 48

**Study Design** : Single arm study with 3 assessment time points.

**Sample Size:** N=15

**Statistical Methods** : All physiology suite parameters were summarized in terms of
means and standard deviation, stratified by assessment time point. Changes from day 1
(pre-patch) to day 2, day 2 to day 7, and day 1 to day 7 were evaluated using a paired ttest or nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.

**GHK- CU Study – Cortisol and DHEAS**

Table 1: Summary statistics for AUC of Cortisol and DHEAS, stratified by assessment time point ........... 53

Table 2: Change from R1 to R2, R2 to R3 and R1 to R3 .............................................................................. 53

**Study Design** : Single arm study with 3 assessment time points.

**Sample Size:** N=15

**Statistical Methods** : Cortisol levels were obtained at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm and 12am.
DHEAS levels were collected at 8am, 8pm and 12am. The area under the curve (AUC)
for Cortisol and DHEAS levels over the data collection periods were calculated using the
trapezoid rule. AUC levels were summarized in terms of means and standard deviations,
stratified by assessment time point. Changes between assessment time points were
evaluated using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test.

**Appendix B: Graphs of Amino Acids Showing Significance**


You will note that Glycine and Glutamate which are used in the process to form


Glutathione both showed a drop off at a level of significance. Gluthione is part of the


reduction of inflammation pathway in a unique aspect. It specifically acts from the liver


to detoxify the blood. So for example it clears heavy metals from the body rather than


acting as an anti-inflammatory agent directly. A decrease in the materials that produce the


glutathione means that more glutathione is being made. This results in higher availability


of the glutathione in the blood. This allows the body to clear more material which is


damaging to the body faster.


Each of the graphs presented below are Box-Whisker plots for the changes in the


various lab parameter values from baseline. The middle line represents the median


change; the lower and upper lines of the box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles.
