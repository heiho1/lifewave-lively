Effect of LifeWave X39TM Patches on Brain as Seen with P3 
Brain Mapping: Preliminary Results 
Principal Investigator: Gaétan Chevalier, Ph.D., Research Director (Bio in Appendix A) 
Co-Investigator: Mary D. Clark, Ph.D., Managing Director (Bio in Appendix B) 
Abstract: Brain mapping measurements were performed on twelve (12) heathy older adult 
participants before, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks of use of Lifewave X39TM patches 12 
hour a day. All participants showed dramatic changes in their scalp topographic maps 
reporting the amplitude of the P300 recording for each channel and also in their coherence 
maps. According to their coherence maps, the majority of participants started with an over 
active brain and their brain calmed down significantly after 3 weeks of wearing the X39TM 
patch. Several participants reported various notable improvements and most participants 
reported feeling slightly better or a lot better at the end of their participation. There was a 
statistically significant increase in physical reaction time at Session 2 that may be due to the 
effect of the X39TM patch on the physiology of the participants. The fact that the physical 
reaction time returned to the initial average value after 6 weeks suggests that there is a 
temporary physiological effect due to the X39TM patch that readjusts itself to a normal level 
within a 6-week period. The significantly lower average values of Audio P300 Voltage at 
Session 2 and at Session 3 compared to Session 1, coupled with the coherence results, 
suggest that the initial Audio P300 Voltage was high and reflects a hyperactive brain. 
Application of a X39TM patch for 3 weeks brought the Audio P300 Voltage to a normal level 
and that level stayed normal until the end of the 6-week duration of the study. 
 
Goal: This is a pilot project using brain mapping to assess any differences in brain function 
after using Lifewave X39TM for 6 weeks.  
 
Statement of Work: Brain mapping measurements were performed on twelve (12) 
healthy older adult participants before, after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks of use of Lifewave 
X39TM patches 12 hours a day as recommended by the Sponsor. Additionally, we monitored 
mood and well-being levels of each subject at each brain mapping measurement using well 
accepted psychological tests. The Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS) was used for mood 
and the Arizona Integrated Outcome Visual Analog Scale (AIO-VAS) for well-being. 
 
Equipment: Sponsor provided Lifewave X39TM patches with detailed information on how to 
use them (location on the body, duration for the use of the patch, frequency of patches 
replacement, etc.). The brain mapping equipment used for this project was the p3 Baseline 
brain mapping system (www.p3baseline.com), a non-invasive commercially available device 
that is FDA cleared for use in routine clinical and research settings.  
Participants Selection: To be accepted in the study, potential participants were 
required to comply with the following criteria:

• Healthy adult between the ages 50 and 80 years old; 
• No mental disorder; 
• Did not receive treatment for mental disorder or taken psychotropic medication within 
the past 2 years; 
• No prescribed medication taken (less than two months prior to participation); 
• No cardiovascular or pulmonary condition such as asthma or heartbeat irregularities; 
• No use of recreational drugs, cigarettes or vaping; 
• No simultaneous participation in any other research project; 
• No previous utilization of LifeWave X39TM Patches;  
• No consumption of alcohol within 48 hours of participation; 
• No food, caffeine or other stimulants within 2 hours prior of participation 
• Agree and able to wear a patch for 12 hours daily for 6 weeks 
• Commit to come to Psy-Tek lab 3 times (each appointment was approx. 2 hours) 
 
Procedure and Methodology 
Once a potential participant met all the inclusion criteria, an appointment was set up to have 
the participant come to the lab for the first testing. Once at Psy-Tek Labs, the participant had 
the opportunity to ask questions and when all questions were answered the participant 
signed the consent form. At the beginning of each visit, each participant was asked to fill two 
questionnaires: one about mood (Brief Mood Introspection Scale or BMIS) and the other 
about well-being (Arizona Integrated Outcome Visual Analog Scale or AIO-VAS). Next, the 
technician ran the following brain scan tests: 
 
• 
P300 Eyes Closed Auditory ERP (provides measures of cognitive response) 
• 
Eyes Opened Focused Test (EEG measurement of brain wave patterns) 
• 
Flanker Test (Eriksen flanker test provides a measure of cognitive control) 
• 
2 Trail Making Tests (provides a measure of visual control and task switching) 
 
In all, brain mapping measurements were performed on each participant 3 times: before, 
after 3 weeks and after 6 weeks of use of LifeWave X39TM patches for 12 hours a day as 
recommended by the Sponsor. After all measurements were done at the last visit, 
participants filled a final questionnaire, the Overall Wellness Assessment Form.

Results 
 
Participant 1 
 
Female, 77, Yoga instructor. During the entire experiment she placed the X39TM patch at the 
back of middle neck. At her first visit she indicated that her sense of well-being was very high 
(100%) on the AIO-VAS (0 = worst you have ever been; 100% = best you have ever been) 
and her mood was +10 according to the BMIS (the BMIS scale goes from -10 = very 
unpleasant to +10 = very pleasant). The AIO-VAS and the BMIS scores were the same also 
at her second visit and her third and final visit. At her third visit she indicated that her 
discipline in doing her morning exercises and meditation greatly improved. She also indicated 
that she had vivid dreams during the experiment. In the Overall Wellness Assessment Form 
(always filled at the end of their participation) she indicated that she felt slightly better than 
usual at her first visit, and a lot better than usual at her second and third visits.  
 
Scalp Topography Map 
 
 
These scalp topographical maps were computed from the 19 EEG channels recorded by the 
brain mapping system (frontal part of the brain at the top and back of the head at the bottom 
of each circle). These maps show the amplitude of the P300 recording for each channel (in 
microvolts or µV) using a color-coding scale presented on the right side referenced to 
Session 3 (red is for the maximum amplitude of 13 µV and dark blue for the minimum 
amplitude of 6 µV). It can be noted that when she came in, her brain was hyperactive. Her 
brain calmed down dramatically at the second visit (Session 2), after wearing the X39TM 
patch for 3 weeks. Her brain remained calm after wearing the patch for 6 weeks (Session 3).

The coherence diagrams above show a perspective where we are looking down at the top of 
the head from above (FP1 and FP2 are on the forehead while O1 and O2 are at the back of 
the head). EEG coherence can be defined as the normalized cross-power spectrum per 
frequency of two signals recorded simultaneously at different sites of the scalp. It is a 
measure of the synchronization between the two signals and may be interpreted as an 
expression of their functional interaction (1). Coherence reflects how stable the phase 
relationship is between two electrode sites. Coherence quantifies the degree of interaction or 
communication, shared information, between brain sites. Hypercoherence is when brain sites 
are not functioning in efficient interdependent fashion, they have too much “cross-talk”, they 
are overly connected or locked together. Hypocoherence is called poor inter-site interaction 
and is associated with diminished cognitive efficiency (2). The red lines between two sites 
indicate hypercoherence while blue lines reflect hypocoherence. Beta brain waves are 
normally dominant in a person awake, alert, with normal level of consciousness and brain 
function. Alpha become dominant in a person with eyes closed, calm, aware and quietly alert. 
Theta brain waves show up in deep relaxation, meditation and mental imagery (3). 
Participants were awake with eyes closed during these measurements and so the most 
relevant results are those presented in the Alpha (relaxation) and Beta (normal brain activity) 
bands.  
 
At the beginning of her participation (Session 1), Participant 1 had most of her brain sites in 
hypercoherence for all 3 frequency bands (Beta, Alpha and Theta). After wearing the X39TM 
patch for 3 weeks (Session 2), most of the frontal part of the brain was still in 
hypercoherence (mainly in Alpha) and after wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks (Session 3) 
there was less hypercoherence that was more evenly distributed both among brain sites and 
frequency bands.

The goal is for each screening score to be inside the target range. If a score is below or 
above the target range it is considered abnormal (too fast if below or too slow if above the 
target time). An explanation of each screening score follows. These explanations are 
provided by p3baseline (www.p3baseline.com). 
 
Physical Reaction time  
 
It is a measure of speed in response to an audible odd tone. This relies on different pathways 
than the Auditory P300, so physical reaction time may be different than the brain speed. 
 
Trail Making 
 
A standard measure of brain function and includes measures of psychomotor and visual 
scanning.  
 
Evoked Potentials - Auditory P300 
 
Auditory P300 is a measure of brain response speed and attentional resources. P300 
slowing and/or a reduction in voltage may signal changes in cognitive function. 
State - CZ Theta/Beta 
Theta and Beta frequency bands are affected by cortical arousal and can give insight into 
how the brain functions. In some people high Theta/Beta ratios at CZ may present as 
inattention, while others may benefit from cortical arousal.  
Researchers have shown that calculating the relative power ratio Theta/Beta at CZ can be 
used to determine slow-wave disorders, ADHD, interpersonal detachment with qualitative 
aspects of autistic or Asperger's behavior (3, 4, 5).  
State - F3/F4 Alpha 
Large differences in Alpha power between the left-front and right-front of the brain have been 
associated with depression and/or anxiety.  
Researchers also discovered that calculating F3/F4 relative power ratio in the Alpha band 
means processing information in a positive way for an increase while a decrease in the ratio 
indicated a more negative processing mode (6, 7).

Participant 2 
 
Female, 67, manual therapist, specializing in craniosacral and massage. She indicated that 
she has pain in bones, joint, or muscles that is aggravated by exercise. During her 
participation in the study she placed the patch 3 inches below the navel. At her first visit her 
sense of well-being on the AIO-VAS was at 71% VAS (0 = worst you have ever been; 100% 
= best you have ever been) and her mood at +9 on the BMIS (the BMIS scale goes from -10 
= very unpleasant to +10 = very pleasant). At her second visit she indicated that her well-
being score on the AIO-VAS was 57% and her mood was +5 on the BMIS scale. At her third 
and final visit she indicated that her well-being score was 63% and her BMIS mood score 
was +8. In the Overall Wellness Assessment Form, she indicated that she felt slightly better 
than usual at all 3 visits.

wearing the X39TM patch for 3 weeks and became even calmer after wearing the X39TM 
patch for 6 weeks (Session 3).

without muscle cramps, feeling better about workouts with less pain. She also indicated that 
she is more even keeled, mentally alert, sharp and that her skin is a little dryer. The Overall

target time). An explanation of each of screening score follows. These explanations are 
provided by p3baseline (www.p3baseline.com). 
 
Physical Reaction time  
 
It is a measure of speed in response to an audible odd tone. This relies on different pathways 
than the Auditory P300, so physical reaction time may be different than the brain speed. 
 
Trail Making 
 
A standard measure of brain function and includes measures of psychomotor and visual 
scanning.  
 
Evoked Potentials - Auditory P300 
 
Auditory P300 is a measure of brain response speed and attentional resources. P300 
slowing and/or a reduction in voltage may signal changes in cognitive function. 
State - CZ Theta/Beta 
Theta and Beta frequency bands are affected by cortical arousal and can give insight into 
how the brain functions. In some people high Theta/Beta ratios at CZ may present as 
inattention, while others may benefit from cortical arousal.  
Researchers have shown that calculating the relative power ratio Theta/Beta at CZ can be 
used to determine slow-wave disorders, ADHD, interpersonal detachment with qualitative 
aspects of autistic or Asperger's behavior (3, 4, 5).  
State - F3/F4 Alpha 
Large differences in Alpha power between the left-front and right-front of the brain have been 
associated with depression and/or anxiety.  
Researchers also discovered that calculating F3/F4 relative power ratio in the Alpha band 
means processing information in a positive way for an increase while a decrease in the ratio 
indicated a more negative processing mode (6, 7).  
 
Participant 5 
 
Female, 63, Pranic healer. She indicated that she has a history of thyroid problems that she 
is treating with natural remedies. She experiences shortness of breath with heavy activity. 
She had a small skin cyst removed in August. For the entire duration of her participation she

placed the patch in the middle of the neck. At her first visit she indicated that her sense of 
well-being was 74% on the AIO-VAS (0 = worst you have ever been; 100% = best you have 
ever been) and her mood was +7 according to the BMIS (the BMIS scale goes from -10 = 
very unpleasant to +10 = very pleasant). At her second visit, her AIO-VAS score stayed at 
74% and the BMIS score also stayed at +7. At her third visit her AIO-VAS score increased to 
93% and her BMIS score increased to +9. The Overall Wellness Assessment form indicated 
that she felt as usual at the beginning of her participation and a lot better after 3 weeks and 6 
weeks into her participation. 
 
Scalp Topography Map 
 
 
 
These scalp topographical maps were computed from the 19 EEG channels recorded by the 
brain mapping system. These maps show the amplitude of the P300 recording for each 
channel (in microvolts or µV) using a color-coding scale presented on the right side 
referenced to Session 3 (red is for the maximum amplitude of 9 µV and dark blue for the 
minimum amplitude of 2 µV). It can be noted that when she came in, her brain shows high 
activity in the right hemisphere and low activity in the left hemisphere. Her brain calmed down 
dramatically at the second visit (Session 2), 3 weeks after wearing the X39TM patch for 3 
weeks. After wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks, her brain more active (Session 3).

EEG coherence can be defined as the normalized cross-power spectrum per frequency of 
two signals recorded simultaneously at different sites of the scalp. It is a measure of the 
synchronization between the two signals and may be interpreted as an expression of their 
functional interaction (1). Coherence reflects how stable the phase relationship is between 
two electrode sites. Coherence quantifies the degree of interaction or communication, shared 
information, between brain sites. Hypercoherence is when brain sites are not functioning in 
efficient interdependent fashion, they have too much “cross-talk”, they are overly connected 
or locked together. Hypocoherence is called poor inter-site interaction and is associated with 
diminished cognitive efficiency (2). The red lines between two sites indicate hypercoherence 
while blue lines reflect hypocoherence. Beta brain waves are normally dominant in a person 
awake, alert, with normal level of consciousness and brain function. Alpha become dominant 
in a person with eyes closed, calm, aware and quietly alert. Theta brain waves show up in 
deep relaxation, meditation and mental imagery (3). Participants were awake with eyes 
closed during these measurements and so the most relevant results are those presented in 
the Alpha (relaxation) and Beta (normal brain activity) bands.  
 
At the beginning of her participation (Session 1), Participant 5 had most of her brain sites in 
hypercoherence for all 3 frequency bands (Beta, Alpha and Theta). After wearing the X39TM 
patch for 3 weeks (Session 2), there was only a few lines of hypocoherence, mainly in the 
occipital (back) region of her brain at all brain frequencies. After wearing the X39TM patch for 
6 weeks (Session 3) there was a bit more hypercoherence than at 3 weeks mainly on the 
right side of the brain with some hypocoherence mainly in the middle of the brain (more so at 
Alpha and Theta).

according to the BMIS (the BMIS scale goes from -10 = very unpleasant to +10 = very 
pleasant). At her second visit, her AIO-VAS score deceased to 22% and the BMIS score  
became -4 (she indicated that she went through an emotional upset). At her third visit her

At the beginning of her participation (Session 1), Participant 6 had a mix of hypercoherence 
(mainly Beta and Alpha) and hypocoherence (Theta). After wearing the X39TM patch for 3 
weeks (Session 2), most of the hypercoherence disappeared (except for a little bit in the back 
of the brain at Alpha and Beta frequency bands) mainly in the occipital (back) region of the 
head for all frequency bands. After wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks (Session 3) 
hypercoherence reappeared in the frontal region of the brain, mainly in Beta and Alpha 
frequency bands.

EEG coherence can be defined as the normalized cross-power spectrum per frequency of 
two signals recorded simultaneously at different sites of the scalp. It is a measure of the 
synchronization between the two signals and may be interpreted as an expression of their 
functional interaction (1). Coherence reflects how stable the phase relationship is between 
two electrode sites. Coherence quantifies the degree of interaction or communication, shared 
information, between brain sites. Hypercoherence is when brain sites are not functioning in 
efficient interdependent fashion, they have too much “cross-talk”, they are overly connected 
or locked together. Hypocoherence is called poor inter-site interaction and is associated with 
diminished cognitive efficiency (2). The red lines between two sites indicate hypercoherence 
while blue lines reflect hypocoherence. Beta brain waves are normally dominant in a person 
awake, alert, with normal level of consciousness and brain function. Alpha become dominant 
in a person with eyes closed, calm, aware and quietly alert. Theta brain waves show up in 
deep relaxation, meditation and mental imagery (3). Participants were awake with eyes 
closed during these measurements and so the most relevant results are those presented in 
the Alpha (relaxation) and Beta (normal brain activity) bands.  
 
At the beginning of his participation (Session 1), Participant 9 had some level of 
hypocoherence in the occipital (back) of the head at all 3 frequency bands (Beta, Alpha and 
Theta). After wearing the X39TM patch for 3 weeks (Session 2), a few hypercoherence lines 
appeared in the frontal region of the brain with similar level of hypocoherence in the back of  
 
the head at all frequency bands. After wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks (Session 3) there 
was an increase in hypercoherence mainly in the frontal part of the brain and all frequency 
bands and hypocoherence in the occipital (back) of the head at all 3 frequency bands.

target time). An explanation of each of screening score follows. These explanations are 
provided by p3baseline (www.p3baseline.com). 
 
Physical Reaction time  
 
It is a measure of speed in response to an audible odd tone. This relies on different pathways 
than the Auditory P300, so physical reaction time may be different than the brain speed. 
 
Trail Making 
 
A standard measure of brain function and includes measures of psychomotor and visual 
scanning.  
 
Evoked Potentials - Auditory P300 
 
Auditory P300 is a measure of brain response speed and attentional resources. P300 
slowing and/or a reduction in voltage may signal changes in cognitive function. 
State - CZ Theta/Beta 
Theta and Beta frequency bands are affected by cortical arousal and can give insight into 
how the brain functions. In some people high Theta/Beta ratios at CZ may present as 
inattention, while others may benefit from cortical arousal.  
Researchers have shown that calculating the relative power ratio Theta/Beta at CZ can be 
used to determine slow-wave disorders, ADHD, interpersonal detachment with qualitative 
aspects of autistic or Asperger's behavior (3, 4, 5).  
State - F3/F4 Alpha 
Large differences in Alpha power between the left-front and right-front of the brain have been 
associated with depression and/or anxiety.  
Researchers also discovered that calculating F3/F4 relative power ratio in the Alpha band 
means processing information in a positive way for an increase while a decrease in the ratio 
indicated a more negative processing mode (6, 7).  
 
Participant 10 
 
Male, 65, construction consultant/PM. He indicated that he experiences swelling of the 
ankles or lower extremities and problems or pain in his bones, joints or muscles. He also 
indicated that he has a history of diabetes or thyroid, kidney or liver disease. For the entire

duration of his participation he placed the patch at the back in the middle neck area. At his 
first visit he indicated that his sense of well-being was 69% on the AIO-VAS (0 = worst you 
have ever been; 100% = best you have ever been) and his mood was +6 according to the 
BMIS (the BMIS scale goes from -10 = very unpleasant to +10 = very pleasant). At his 
second visit, her AIO-VAS score increased to 78% and the BMIS score became +9. At his 
third visit his AIO-VAS score decreased a bit to 68% and his BMIS score decreased to +8. 
The Overall Wellness Assessment form indicated that his feeling was as usual at the 
beginning of his participation and increase to slightly better than usual at the second and 
third visits.  
 
Scalp Topography Map 
 
 
 
These scalp topographical maps were computed from the 19 EEG channels recorded by the 
brain mapping system. These maps show the amplitude of the P300 recording for each 
channel (in microvolts or µV) using a color-coding scale presented on the right side 
referenced to Session 3 (red is for the maximum amplitude of 8 µV and dark blue for the 
minimum amplitude of 0 µV). It can be noted that when he came in, his brain was more 
active at the right parietal region of his brain. His brain became very hyperactive at the 
second visit (Session 2), after wearing the X39TM patch for 3 weeks. His brain calmed down 
quite a bit after wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks (Session 3). The patterns of brain 
activity were different too with most activity in the middle and right parts of the brain.

wearing the X39TM patch for 6 weeks (Session 3) there was a small increase in 
hypocoherence mainly in the occipital part of the brain for Beta and Alpha frequency bands 
and a huge increase in hypercoherence of the entire head at the Theta frequency band. This

over all participants. The means were compared between sessions for statistical significance 
using t-test or a non-parametric equivalent. As shown in the table below significant results 
were obtained for Physical Reaction Time and Audio P300 Voltage. According to the table, 
physical reaction time increased significantly at Session 2 compared to Session 1. There was 
no significant difference between Session 3 and Session 1 suggesting a return of the 
reaction time to that before the start of the experiment.  Audio P300 Voltage decreased 
significantly at Session 2 and Session 3 compared to Session 1. The usual critical value of 
0.05 was used to determine statistical significance (significant results are presented in red in

Discussion 
 
All participants showed dramatic changes in their scalp topographic maps reporting the 
amplitude of the P300 recording for each channel and also in their coherence maps. 
According to their coherence maps, the majority of participants started with an over active 
brain (#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #11 and #12) and their brain calmed down significantly after 
3 weeks of wearing the X39TM patch. For #6 and #7 the brain became very active again after 
6 weeks. For #12 the brain became more active after 3 weeks and calmed down only after 6 
weeks. Participant 8 experienced a great increase in brain activity after 3 weeks. Her brain 
calmed down significantly and became more normal (i.e. less high or low coherences) after 6 
weeks. Participants 9 and 10 experienced a dramatic increase in brain activity only at the 6 
weeks visit. Several participants reported various improvements (#1, #3, #7, #8) and most of 
them reported feeling slightly better or a lot better at the end of their participation (#1, #2, #3, 
#5, #7, #8, #10, #11). 
 
The statistically significant increase in physical reaction time at Session 2 may be due to the 
effect of the X39TM patch on the physiology of the participants. The fact that the physical 
reaction time returned to the initial average value after 6 weeks suggests that there is a 
temporary physiological effect due to the X39TM patch that readjusts itself to a normal level 
within a 6-week period. The significantly lower average values of Audio P300 Voltage at 
Session 2 and at Session 3 compared to Session 1, coupled with the coherence results, 
suggest that the initial Audio P300 Voltage was high and reflects a brain that is hyperactive. 
Application of a X39TM patch for 3 weeks brought the Audio P300 Voltage to a normal level 
and that levels stayed normal at the end of 6 weeks.

Conclusion 
 
All participants showed dramatic changes in their scalp topographic maps reporting the 
amplitude of the P300 recording for each channel and also in their coherence maps. 
According to their coherence maps, the majority of participants started with an over active 
brain and their brain calmed down significantly after 3 weeks of wearing the X39TM patch. 
Several participants reported various notable improvements and most participants reported 
feeling slightly better or a lot better at the end of their participation. 
 
There was a statistically significant increase in physical reaction time at Session 2 that may 
be due to the effect of the X39TM patch on the physiology of the participants. The fact that the 
physical reaction time returned to the initial average value after 6 weeks suggests that there 
is a temporary physiological effect due to the X39TM patch that readjusts itself to a normal 
level within a 6-week period. The significantly lower average values of Audio P300 Voltage at 
Session 2 and at Session 3 compared to Session 1, coupled with the coherence results, 
suggest that the initial Audio P300 Voltage was high and reflects a hyperactive brain. 
Application of a X39TM patch for 3 weeks brought the Audio P300 Voltage to a normal level 
and that level stayed normal until the end of the 6-week duration of the study.
