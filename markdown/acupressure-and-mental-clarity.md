|L.I.-4 and the Pericardium channel (from wrapping themiddle finger) always have more stimulation than others.Also, wrist points including Taiyuan LU-9 and ShenmenHE-7 receive stronger pressure compared to the other pointson the body of the forearm.

The only differenceis that the the Ashkenazi style excludes Taiyuan LU-9. Thisshould have little clinical significance, given the scope ofthe remaining points in the formula.**_Point and channel discussion_**• The Governing Vessel (Du Mai) is an extra-ordinarymeridian that runs up the spine and penetrates the brain. Itis well known for its ability to treat psychiatric disordersand influence the mind8.
