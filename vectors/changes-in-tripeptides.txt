Abstract 
 
Purpose - To determine if the LifeWave X39 non-transdermal patch can produce changes in tripeptides 
GHK and GHK-Cu production. 
Materials- BD Vacutainer Safety Loc Blood Collection sets with Pre-attached holder sized 21GX0.75 or 
23GX0.75, lavender top tubes, KendroSorvallBiofuge Centrifuge 75005184+, sterile eye droppers, 
polystyrene containers, thermal liners and an AB Sciex API4000 Qtrap. Analysis software included: 
Qtrap Analyst software 1.6.2. and R software version 3.5.1. 
Method - Blood was drawn into lavender top tubes on day 1, 2 and 7 with blood collection sets and 
spun in KendroSorvall centrifuge for 10 minutes at1300rcf at room temperature. The plasma was 
placed in cryo tubes and flash frozen using dryice, then shipped to the laboratory for analysis. Once 
there the blood samples were processed according to the original thesis of Dr. Pickard. The filtrate was 
concentrated by speed-vac and reconstituted with de-ionized water to50µland analyzed with AB Sciex 
API4000 Qtrap. The data was analyzed with Analyst software 1.6.2. Results were then sent for 
statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. All reported p-values are two-sided and p<0.05 
was used to define statistical significance. Statistical analyses were conducted with R software version 
3.5.1. "Copper tripeptide-1(GHK-Cu) is a small protein composed of the three amino acids (protein 
building blocks) glycine, histidine, and lysine combined in a specific geometric configuration with the 
physiologically beneficial mineral (copper)” (DeHaven, 2014). It helps repair and maintain all tissue 
types(DeHaven, 2014).  
Results - There was a significant increase in GHK in blood seen at 24 hours, p<0.0098. A significant 
increase in GHK-Cu in the blood was also seen at 7 days, p<0.0137.  
Conclusion - This pilot study explored changes in amounts of GHK and GHK-Cu present inblood due 
to wearing the LifeWave X39 patch for 1 week. There was a significant increase of GHK in blood seen 
at 24 hours, p<0.0098. A significant increase in GHK-Cu in blood was also seen at 7 days, p<0.0137.

Introduction  
 
This pilot study explores the impact of wearing the LifeWave X39 patch for one week on levels of GHK and GHK-
Cu levels in blood. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 24 hours and 7 days of wearing the patch. A sample of 
convenience of 10 subjects made up of both men and women aged 40-81 were selected to participate in this 
study.

Background  
 
Phototherapy  
Phototherapy in various forms has been used for over 100 years and has shown benefits for a variety 
of skin diseases (Singer&Berneburg, 2018), foot ulcer healing, specifically with diabetes (Wang, et al, 
2017), and even a first line therapy for mycosis fungoides. (Dogra&Mahajan, 2015). There has been 
little evidence of negative side effects. This suggests that this is a relatively untapped option for healing 
with relatively few risks. 
    The LifeWave X39 patch uses phototherapy to stimulate a rebalancing of the body. Merriam-Webster 
Dictionarydefines "Phototherapy" as "light therapy" (Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, 2020). It is the 
use of light in specific wavelengths that vary based on the intended effect to stimulate a specific 
physiological change.  
    "Copper tripeptide-1(GHK-Cu) is a small protein composed of the three amino acids (protein building 
blocks) glycine, histidine, and lysine combined in a specific geometric configuration with the 
physiologically beneficial mineral (copper)” (DeHaven, 2014). This tripeptide was first isolated from 
human plasma albumin in 1973 by Dr. Loren Pickart. Additional research has established the strong 
affinity the GHK peptide has for copper, and exists in twoforms, GHK and GHK-Cu(DeHaven, 2014). To 
date, no research of the use of GHK and GHK-Cu has shown elevated liver enzymes (Pickart& Thaler, 
1973; Pickart, Thayer, & Thaler, 1973; DeHaven, 2014) 
    Based on anecdotal observation it was felt that a possible change in both the tripeptide GHK and the 
copper tripeptide GHK-Cu might be factors in the effects produced by the patch described below.  
Research has identified that the GHK and GHK-Cu peptides are used to signal the beginning of the 
natural repair process anddemonstrated to improve tissue remodelingGHK-Cuincreases keratinocyte 
proliferation and normal collagen synthesis, improves skin thickness, skin elasticity and firmness, 
improves wrinkles, photodamage and uneven pigmentation, improves skin clarity, and tightens 
protective barrier proteins.” (DeHaven, 2014) 
 
Purpose of study 
 
To determine if the LifeWave X39 non-transdermal patch produced changes in tripeptides GHK and 
GHK-Cu production. 
 
Non-transdermal Patch  
 
All X39 patches are sealed so that none of the substances in the patch actually penetrate the skin.This 
allows for consistent patch promotion of the electrodermal skin response in the infrared, near infrared, 
and visible light spectrumsthroughout the time the patch is worn.Electrodermal activity (EDA) is the 
property of the human body that causes continuous variation in the electrical characteristics of the 
skin.Patches are designed to reflect wavelengths of light in the infrared, near infrared, and visible light 
bands.The patches act as a transducer and transmitter, like a router on a computer network, or one of 
the old crystal radio sets. They receive signals from the body, strengthen them, send them back, and 
then the body receives them.The patches use the same adhesives as band-aids. This limits the level of 
irritation caused by the adhesive which might be developed through consistent daily use of the patch. 
 
Meridian Implications and Patch placement  
 
Specific meridian points were chosen to maintain consistency and improve comparability between 
studies. They were also chosen for ease of access and description in the future.   
 
Procedure 
 
Once human research studies ethics board approval was received (NFFEH 06-26-19-05), recruitment

was begun. Flyers advertising for interested research participants were posted at various local sites. 
Participants would call into the main study phone number and were assessed according to[inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Participants were required to be between the ages of 40 and 81, and to not have 
a history of any significant mental health issues which might have compromised their ability to consent 
to participating in the study. At the time of arrival at the study site, each participant matching the 
selection criteria signed their consent.  Individual participants were then taken into the exam room and 
a blood sample was taken at baseline, 24 hours and 7 days of patch placement. Half the participants 
used the CV6 point and half used the GV14 point 
BD Vacutainer Safety Loc Blood Collection sets were used with Pre-attached holder sized 21GX0.75 or 
23GX0.75 and placed in lavender top tubes. Each blood sample was then placed in the 
KendroSorvallBiofuge centrifuge 75005184+ HERAEUS 7591 with a 4000 RPM rotor, andspun for 10 
minutes at 1300rcf at room temperature to separate the plasma.The plasmawas then placed in cryo 
tubes, and flash frozen using dry ice. Samples were then placed in 2" thick polystyrene containers, 
wrapped in thermal box liners and placed in double walled boxes for overnight shipping to HT-Labs, a 
division of AxisPharm in San Diego, CA for analysis.  
 
Analysis of Blood Samples 
 
The blood samples were processed according to the original thesis of Dr. Pickard(Pickart& Thaler, 
1973) AGAIN WHICH Pickart?]. The filtrate was concentrated by speed-vac and reconstituted with de-
ionized water to 50µland analyzed with AB Sciex API4000 Qtrap. The data was analyzed with Qtrap 
Analyst software 1.6.2.  
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Absolute changes in GHK and GHK-CU levels from baseline, 24 hours, and day 7 assessments were 
summarized in terms of means, standard deviations, medians and ranges. Changes from baseline to 
the 24 hours and day 7 assessments were evaluated using a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. 
All reported p-values are two-sided and p<0.05 was used to define statistical significance. Statistical 
analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.1; http://www.r-project.org/). 
 
Results 
 
Our sample of convenience of individuals consisted of 10 individuals, with four men and six women in 
the study.They had a mean age of 64.2, with an age range of 41 - 73.  See significant results of the 
LifeWave X39 patch testing in Table 1.:

The blood analysis of GHK showed an increase at levels at p< 0.0098 within 24 hours and GHK-Cu 
also showed an increase at p<0.01 at 7 days.  
 
Discussion  
 
It is important to recognize that this was both a sample of convenience with a small sample size in a 
pilot study. However, there was a significant change in the levels of both GHK at 24 hours and GHK-Cu 
in 7 days. This implies promotion of positive benefits to the body. Further study will need to be done

with larger sample sizes and control groups to determine if there is a consistency of results over 
repeated trials and statistically significant changes when compared with a control group. 
 
Conclusion  
 
This pilot study explored the changes in amounts of GHK and GHK-Cu present in the blood as a result 
of wearing the LifeWave X39 patch for 1 week. There was a significant increase in GHK in the 
blood,seen at 24 hours, at the level of p<0.0098. A significant increase in GHK-Cu in the blood was 
also seen at 7 days, at the level of p<0.0137.
