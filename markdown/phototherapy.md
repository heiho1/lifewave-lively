**ABSTRACT**


**Purpose:** _To determine X-39 patch impact in stimulation of Copper peptide biosynthesis and bio-available_
_amino acid levels, neurotransmitters production, memory, sleep quality, vitality, muscle relaxation and_
_blood pressure._


**Materials:** _Biography Infinity physiology suite: Heart rate variability (HRV), GSR, EMG, EKG, blood_
_volume pulse (BVP), temperature and respiration. Questionnaires: Marlow-Crowne, Global Mood Scale,_
_Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, Arizona Integrative Outcomes scale. WAIS III memory test. Amino acid and_
_neurotransmitters testing of urine._


**Method:** _Subjects were recruited (age 40 - 81), consented, randomized and scheduled. Data taken day 1,_
_day 2, and day 7 except Marlow-Crowne taken day 1 and day 7._


**Results:** _Improvements in short term memory p<0.001, sleep quality p<0.04, vitality p<0.03 day 2 and_
_p<0.08 at day 7. Blood pressure change in VLF on day 7 at p<0.02, respiration on day 7 at p<0.04._
_Increase in amino acids: Creatinine, Normetanephrine, methionine, homocystine, isoleucine, glutamine,_
_cysteine, 5-hydroxytrytophane, β-aminobutyric-acid._


**Conclusion:** _The results of the double blind randomized controlled trial of 50 subjects with mean age 63_
_years, using the LifeWave non-transdermal X-39 phototherapy patch worn 8-12 hours per day for seven_
_days produced an increase in 8 amino acids at significant levels. The study showed, there was an_
_improvement in short term memory as measured by the WAIS III memory test at significant levels over 7_
_days, in Quality of Sleep at significant levels within 24 hours and a self reported increase in vitality at near_
_significant levels in 7 days as measured by the Arizona Integrative Outcomes scale._


_Our findings suggest this patch is not only stimulating the biosynthesis of copper-peptide production, but_
_also increases neurotransmitters production and improves metabolism. Additional studies could address_
_underlying mechanisms of action to the phototherapy process and longer periods of study might be explored_
_for additional potential physical changes and longevity of the demonstrated changes._

**I** **NTRODUCTION**


The Lifewave X39 non-transdermal patch
focuses on stimulating the copper tripeptide
GHK- Cu [1,2,3]. “Copper tripeptide-1(GHKCu) is a small protein composed of the three
amino acids glycine, histidine, and lysine



combined in a specific geometric configuration
with the physiologically beneficial mineral
(copper)” [4]. The goal of this research was to
determine X-39 patch impact in stimulation of
Copper peptide biosynthesis and bio-available
amino acid levels, neurotransmitters production,
memory, sleep quality, vitality, muscle

relaxation and blood pressure. This tripeptide
was first isolated from human plasma albumin
in 1973 by Dr. Loren Pickart. Pickart, noticed
differences in the levels of fibrinogen based on
age. He additionally noticed that these
differences stopped when the older liver cells
were incubated in blood from younger
individuals. “In 1977, David Schlesinger of the
Harvard University Chemistry Department
confirmed that the growth modulating peptide
isolated by Pickart was a glycyl-L-histidyl-Llysine peptide”[5]. It is interesting to note that
this peptide has also been found in saliva, urine,
and collagen. Additional research has
established the strong affinity the GHK peptide
has for copper, and exists in two forms, as this was
not covered in the initial experiment. These two
forms are GHK and GHK-Cu. It is also important
to mention that none of the research around GHK

has ever found it to cause an issue [4].


Research has identified that the peptide is used
to signal the beginning of the natural repair
process. This benefit has specifically been
documented through research for post-laser or
surgical wounds, ischemic, burns, skin or hair
transplants, and diabetic ulcers. “Diabetic
wounds healed three times faster in the presence
of Copper tripeptide-1. Time to reepithelialization is shortened” [4]. The tripeptide
has also been demonstrated to improve tissue
remodeling. “It increases keratinocyte
proliferation and normal collagen synthesis,
improves skin thickness, skin elasticity and
firmness, improves wrinkles, photodamage and
uneven pigmentation, improves skin clarity, and
tightens protective barrier proteins” [4]. This has
an impact on both scars and other effects of
damage to the skin, and natural aging processes.
The effects of tissue remodeling also appear to
have an impact on cancerous cells. “The fact
that GHK was able to suppress 70% of genes
involved in the development of an aggressive
metastatic form of colon cancer indicates that

GHK is capable of the regulation of various
biochemical pathways on a gene level and it
seems to be resetting the gene activity back to
health, which leads to the improvement of tissue
repair” [6].


GHK-Cu also has a demonstrated impact on
other organs in the body after they have been
damaged. “A collaborative study conducted by
scientists from Boston University, University of
Groningen, University of British Columbia, and
University of Pennsylvania established that the
GHK peptide reverses the gene expression
signature of COPD, which is manifested by



emphysema, inflammation, lung tissue
destruction, and significant reduction of lung
capacity” [6]. It is also important to note that
“…the level of GHK is about 200
ng/mL(10−7M) at age 20 and it declines to 80
ng/mL by age 60” [6]. This likely explains the
increasing effects of aging. It would also
suggest that increased levels over time of GHKCu would have a positive effect on both life
expectancy and aging.


While phototherapy has been defined as “the use
of ultraviolet (UV) light for its healing effects”

[7], the LifeWave patches have been
specifically developed to reflect light in the
infrared and visible light bands back onto the
skin where the patch has been placed. Supported
by normal electro-dermal skin conductance

[8,9], the human body gives off a number of
materials biochemically including particulate
release, gas emission, ultraviolet, infrared, near
infrared, and visible spectrum light. This then
stimulates the area of skin, producing improved
physiological effects. Variations on
phototherapy have been used for at least 100
years. In that time there has been little evidence
of negative side effects. This suggests that this is
a relatively untapped option for healing with
relatively few risks.


**M** **ATERIALS AND** **M** **ETHODS**


This study was done as a whole systems
research randomized controlled double blind

trial of 50 participants. Human studies ethics
approval for this research was given NFFEH 0331-19-02. Participants were recruited using
flyers, emails and radio announcements. A
sample of convenience drawn from those who
responded and met inclusion/exclusion criterion
of men and women age 40-81 with no major
mental health issues who were then randomized

into control and active groups via computer and
to patch placements (GV14, CV6). Patches used
in the trial were mailed prepackaged as groups
A and B and the blind was not broken until after

the statistical analysis was done. Participants
were scheduled for the same time each day for
each of the data points (day1/baseline, day2/24
hours, day 7). Participants were consented, and
data was taken in the following order:
questionnaires, urine sample, physiology
measures. On day one the participant was given
9 days supply of the patches for use in the study.
A one month supply of the active patch was
given at the end of the week's participation and
$20 toward the participants time and gasoline.

**Phototherapy Induced Metabolism Change Produced by the LifeWave X39 Non-transdermal Patch**



The trial was conducted at the Arizona School

of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine clinic in
Tucson, AZ.


**Non-transdermal Patch and Patch Placement**


All X39 patches are sealed so that none of the
substances in the patch actually penetrate the
skin. This allows for consistent patch promotion
of the light flow during the period of patch
application. There is sufficient evidence of
electrical-dermal response in orthopedic
research to use previously measured
acupuncture points as "strategic conductors of
electromagnetic signals" [10]. Two points were
selected for this research so the process of patch
placement could be standardized across the
participant population. Earlier studies of this
patch selected acupuncture/acupressure points
designated GV14 and CV6 [2, 3] and based on
pilot results, the same patch placement was
selected for consistency. Participants were
randomized by computer into groups and the
point usage was selected based on the
randomization.


**Metabolic Suite**


Sabre Sciences Inc. conducted the urine analysis
using their HPA1 metabolic panel using LCMS/MS tandem mass spectrometry. The
metabolic panel measures excreditory level of
amino acids and their metabolites, including
catecholaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic
pathways and metabolites, and trans-sulfuration
and histidine pathways. Three urine data points
were taken on each subject before 10am each of
baseline/day1, at 24 hours/day 2 and on day 7.
Samples were frozen and then shipped to the
Sabre Science laboratory in Carlsbad, CA each
day for analysis.


**Physiology Suite**


The Thought Technology Biography Infinity
physiology suite was used for six minute
measures of heart rate variability (HRV),
galvanic skin response (GSR), EMG, EKG,
blood volume pulse (BVP), temperature and
respiration at each data point.


**Questionnaires**


Questionnaires and memory test were
administered at each data point with the
exception of the Marlow-Crowne which was
administered day one and day seven.


_**Marlowe Crowne**_


The Marlowe Crowne is a 13 Item true/false

short likert scale that measures political



correctness. This instrument was selected to

confirm accuracy of the data. The instrument
takes about 2 minutes to do for most

participants. (Norming: [11].)


_**Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index**_


Normed by Cole et al (2006) this scale is a mix
of quantitative questions and five likert scale
questions 0-3 addressing the participants quality
of sleep.


_**Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale, Visual**_
_**Analogue Scale (AIOS-VAS)**_ _**for Vitality**_


The AIOS- VAS (Normed: [12]) rates subject’s
“overall sense of well-being and vitality.” It
uses a 100mm one-line visual analogue scale on
which the participant notes their sense of well
being with an x on the line.


_**WAS III memory sub-test**_


A subsection of the WAS III was administered

which looks at the level of short, mid and longer
term memory. The test was administered
concurrent to the filling out of other
questionnaires. Ten numbers which were taken
from a randomized list were repeated without
inflection three times to each participant.
Participants were asked to immediately repeat
the numbers back at the end of the third

repetition, then again asked to repeat the
numbers back at 10 minutes and at twenty
minutes. Count was taken of the number of

correct digits in the order originally given.
Count was stopped when an error in the order
was made.


_**Global Mood Scale**_


Denollet normed the Global Mood Scale in

1993. It includes a twenty item, five factor likert
scale that assesses participants current mood and
a one item, ten factor likert scale assessing well
being at the current moment. It was selected
both as a redundant measure comparison to the
AIOS-VAS and an overall assessment of mood.


**Statistical Analysis**


All data results were entered into spread sheets
and they were then analyzed for significant
results. Questionnaires were analyzed for mean
and standard deviation and stratified by
assessment time point. Paired t-test or
nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests
were then done. Physiology measures were
summarized stratified across the 6 study epochs
looking at means and standard deviation. Pre post changes were evaluated using a paired ttest. Distribution assumptions were then verified

using normal probability plots. The values for p
are two-sided and statistical significance was
defined as p<0.05. The metabolic analysis
included stratification by assessment point and
summary means and standard deviation.
Analysis was done including changes from
baseline to day 2, day 2 to day 7 and day 1 to
day 7. These were evaluated using Paired t-test
or nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests.


**R** **ESULTS AND** **D** **ISCUSSION**


This was a double blind randomized controlled

trial with a sample of convenience and which
had a seven day intervention period. While this
was a sample of convenience participants were
recruited through five different methods
including: radio announcements, email, posting
in cafe's and at university center's, prior study
participant announcement lists and through area
community groups. So while this could be
considered a study weakness, the range of
recruiting methods insured a diversity of
population who decided to participate. There
were 26 individuals in the Active group and 24
in the Control group, with an overall mean age
of 63 and a range of 40-81 years. The Active
groups mean age matched the overall mean,
while the Control group was slightly lower at 62
years. Despite the limitations of smaller
participant sample size (N=50) in this study,
there were several interesting significant
changes, as well as some changes of near
significance within the study test results. There
were two adverse events, where two individuals
in the study had headaches while using the
patches. These headaches took place during
monsoon season, and both were individuals who
had a previous history of barometric pressure
triggered migraine headaches. The IRB
reviewed the cases and determined that they
were both consistent with the individuals past



history and had nothing to do with the product.
Two individuals were also dropped from the
study when they did not complete the study

visits.


The specific impact of research location should
also be recognized. Aside from the barometric
pressure effects of monsoon season, this study
largely took place over the summer in Arizona.
This meant that participant hydration was a
constant issue, especially with the necessity of a
urine sample. As such, it was determined that

water had to be available and was offered to

each participant at the beginning of each study
appointment. Included are the significant and
some near significance findings for the
LifeWave non-transdermal X39 phototherapy
patch.


The urine analysis data showed an increase in
amino acids: Creatinine, Normetanephrine,
methionine, homocystine, isoleucine, glutamine,
cysteine, 5-hydroxytrytophane, β-aminobutyricacid. These are important findings as branched
chain amino acids like isoleucine, which is
constantly oxidized in muscle, methionine and
homocystine, are major ingredients of transsulfuration pathway. This pathway is
responsible for methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) production. SAMe is
readily donates methyl groups to other
substances, enabling cardiovascular,
neurological, reproductive and detoxifying
systems. 5-hydroxytrytophane is major building
block of important neurological monoamine
neurotransmitter, serotonin, which later
methylates into melatonin, and is a main
hormone which regulates sleep-wake cycle.
Normetanephrine is a norephinephrine break
down product in dopamine pathway and is
major hormone of neuromodulatory system.

All questionnaire scores were summarized in terms of means and standard deviations (SD), stratified by group (Control vs. Active) and
assessment time point (1, 2, 7). Absolute
changes from baseline (1) to day 2 and baseline
(1) to day 7 were evaluated using a paired t-test significant

- WAIS III (three subscales #Short, # Mid,
#Long)

- Global Mood Scale (two subscale: Positive
Affect (PA), Negative Affect (NA))

- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (total score –
higher score indicates worse sleep quality)



Within the questionnaire results the shifts in
sleep were particularly interesting, as they were
significant in both groups, in opposite
directions. The Active group had a significant
improvement in sleep, and the control group had
a significant decline in sleep. Vitality also
showed a particularly interesting shift, with
significant improvement within 24 hours which
dropped slightly at day 7. The Global mood
scale showed a change in negative affect in both
groups. Additionally the Marlow-Crowne
showed no significance so that responses on the
questionnaires were not as a result of the desire
to provide socially correct or desired answers.

A comparison of this studies results with the
pilot study showed some interesting differences.
The first was the change in the level of
significance in memory improvement. While the
pilot study showed a near significant
improvement in short-term memory, the double
blind showed very clear significance, p<0.001,

**C**

as well as near significance in mid-term
memory. It would be very interesting to see if
this improvement continued to strengthen with a
longer intervention period or a population with a
mean age of 70+.

Of note, was the difference in which amino
acids were significant between the pilot and the
current study. The amino acids which has
significance were further down the
catecholaminergic, serotonergic, and
glutamatergic pathways that the significant
findings of the pilot study. This may be due to
the difference in median age, with the double
blind having an older median population or may
be due to utilization by the body when higher
concentrations of the amino acids were available

for use. It should also be noted that while we

saw more prevalent amino acid changes tied to
antioxidant events in the pilot study, the data
from the double blind shows an overall

rebalancing of the gut and overall improvement
in gut performance.



It would be interesting to determine how long
and at what continuing rate changes to gut



performance, physiological and overall wellness
support would be produced by wearing the
LifeWave X-39 patch. Longer periods of study
such as six to twelve weeks including
comprehensive blood and metabolism testing
might be considered in the future.


**C** **ONCLUSION**

The results of the double blind randomized
controlled trial of 50 subjects on the LifeWave
non-transdermal X-39 phototherapy patch worn
for 8-12 hours per day for seven days produced
an increase in 8 amino acids at 10 significant
levels over the 3 time periods. There was
additional increase in 3 amino acids at near

significance. These specific changes served to
rebalance the gut toward a positive homeostatic
balance. There was an increase in short term

memory as measured by the WAIS III memory
test at significant levels over 7 days. There was
an improvement in Quality of Sleep at
significant levels within 24 hours and a self
reported increase in vitality at near significant
levels in 7 days as measured by the Arizona
Integrative Outcomes scale. Given the mean age
of the population at 63 years this is a substantial
improvement in overall quality of life.
Additional studies could address underlying
mechanisms of action to the phototherapy
process and longer periods of study might be
explored for additional potential physical
changes.
