Abstract
Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of acupressure in terms
of disability, pain scores, and functional status.
Design Randomised controlled trial.
Setting Orthopaedic clinic in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
Participants 129 patients with chronic low back pain.
Intervention Acupressure or physical therapy for one month.
Main outcome measures Self administered Chinese versions of
standard outcome measures for low back pain (primary
outcome: Roland and Morris disability questionnaire) at
baseline, after treatment, and at six month follow-up.
Results The mean total Roland and Morris disability
questionnaire score after treatment was significantly lower in
the acupressure group than in the physical therapy group
regardless of the difference in absolute score ( −3.8, 95%
confidence interval −5.7 to −1.9) or mean change from the
baseline ( −4.64, −6.39 to −2.89). Acupressure conferred an
89% (95% confidence interval 61% to 97%) reduction in
significant disability compared with physical therapy. The
improvement in disability score in the acupressure group
compared with the physical group remained at six month
follow-up. Statistically significant differences also occurred
between the two groups for all six domains of the core
outcome, pain visual scale, and modified Oswestry disability
questionnaire after treatment and at six month follow-up.
Conclusions Acupressure was effective in reducing low back
pain in terms of disability, pain scores, and functional status.
The benefit was sustained for six months.
Introduction
Low back pain is a common health problem worldwide. In addi-
tion to conventional physical therapy, acupuncture—classified in
group 1 of the complementary and alternative therapies (profes-
sionally organised alternative therapies)
1—has been shown to be
effective in alleviating various types of pain.
2 Its efficacy for low
back pain remains elusive, however.
3 Acupressure, another com-
plementary and alternative therapy, has had increasing attention,
as it is manipulated with the fingers instead of needles on the
acupoints and has been used for relieving pain, illness, and inju-
ries in traditional Chinese medicine.
4
The efficacy of acupressure in relieving pain associated with
low back pain has been shown by a randomised controlled trial.
5
However,
the
outcomes
in
that
study
were
assessed
by
description of pain character and failed to take into account
functional status and disability as recommended by most low
back pain researchers.
6 7 Although trials have investigated the
efficacy of physical therapy, acupuncture, and acupressure in
reducing low back pain, the type of outcome measurement has
varied from study to study. To establish a standard instrument for
comparisons
across
studies, a
standardised
“core” set
of
questions and questionnaires (referred to here as standard
outcome measures) has been proposed by an international pro-
gramme on primary care management of low back pain since
1998.
8
We aimed to do a randomised controlled trial using validated
Chinese versions of the standard outcome measures to compare
the efficacy of acupressure with that of physical therapy in allevi-
ating low back pain and to provide a base for comparison across
international studies.
Methods
Study participants
The study took place between 8 January and 12 May 2004, with
follow-up until 12 November 2004. We selected 188 participants
from among the outpatients of a specialist orthopaedic clinic in
Kaoshiung, Taiwan, which offered standardised physical therapy.
Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years and older; they
had had chronic low back pain for more than four months, as
diagnosed by a senior orthopaedic specialist; their chronic low
back pain was not caused by systemic or organic diseases,
cancers, or psychiatric diseases; they were not pregnant; they had
no acute severe pains needing immediate treatment or surgery;
and they had no contraindication to acupressure (that is, no
open wound). All participants gave written informed consent.
Sample size determination
We did a pilot trial before the main study to obtain score means
and standard deviations with the Roland and Morris disability
questionnaire, modified Oswestry disability questionnaire, and
visual analogue scale for estimating sample sizes. We took the
Roland and Morris disability questionnaire as the primary
outcome. To detect the mean difference in score between the two
groups (the mean scores in the pilot study were 28.4 (SD 16.9)
for the acupressure group and 48.0 (SD 22.9) for the physical
therapy group), with a significance level of 5% (two tailed) and
statistical power of 80%, we needed 65 participants in each arm.
Randomisation
A research assistant independently randomised participants by
using a predetermined random table, which was not decoded
until the intervention was assigned. After exclusion of ineligible
patients, 129 (69%) patients aged between 18 and 81 met our eli-
gibility and were randomly allocated to two arms: 64 patients in
the acupressure group and 65 patients in the physical therapy
group.

Interventions
Each participant received six sessions within one month. One
senior acupressure therapist gave each session of acupressure
treatment to ensure a uniform technique and consistent experi-
ence. The participants in the physical therapy group received the
routine physical therapy offered by the orthopaedic specialist
clinic, including pelvic manual traction, spinal manipulation,
thermotherapy, infrared light therapy, electrical stimulation, and
exercise therapy, as decided by the physical therapist.
Blinding
Blinded treatment of acupressure is impractical. To reduce the
“Hawthorne effect” (whereby patients with known higher pain
scores receive more effort from the therapist), both the acupres-
sure therapist and the physical therapists were blind to pretreat-
ment assessment. We asked patients, without referring to the
pretreatment assessment, to assess the post-treatment pain
scores and ratings by filling out the questionnaires or by
telephone interview immediately after completing six treatment
sessions or the one month period, whichever came first. The
research assistant who did the post-treatment and six month
follow-up interviews by telephone was also blind to pretreatment
assessment and was told beforehand not to ask the participants
about the details of the intervention in order to remain blind to
the intervention as far as possible. In addition, to avoid observa-
tion bias, the assessor was blind to intervention group before
analysis of data was complete.
Outcome measurements
Although the Chinese versions of the standard outcome
measures comprise four components—core outcome measures,
Roland and Morris disability questionnaire, Oswestry disability
questionnaire, and EuroQoL—we used only the first three,
because the patients in the pilot study found EuroQoL difficult
to use. We also used a visual analogue scale for recording pain
scores. We asked participants in each group to provide baseline
information,
including
date
of
birth,
sex,
marital
status,
occupation category, educational level, and sleeping quality, and
to complete the Chinese version of the standard outcome meas-
ures at enrolment. We used separate sets of questionnaires for
pretreatment, post-treatment, and six month follow-up assess-
ments by patients and research assistant. To avoid recall bias, only
the reference number and participant’s name were shown on
these questionnaires, without revealing the previous assessment.
We took Roland and Morris disability questionnaire as the
primary
outcome
and
the
other
measures
as
secondary
outcomes.
When evaluating the treatment efficacy, we divided the total
scores
measured
by
the
Roland
and
Morris
disability
questionnaire into two score scales for measuring the degree of
disability, taking 0-12 as minimal disability and 13-24 as
significant disability. We used the modified version of the
Oswestry
disability
questionnaire
used
in
the
American
Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons lumbar cluster, which has
nine questions with six ratings. We summed ratings on each item
as total scores for each patient. We divided the total scores into
five grades for measuring the degree of disability, taking 0-11 as
minimal disability, 12-22 as moderate disability, 23-32 as severe
disability, 33-43 as crippled, and ≥44 as bed bound.
Statistical analysis
For comparisons of baseline variables, we used Student’s t test for
continuous variables and the 
2 test for categorical variables.
Analysis was by intention to treat. For participants lost to follow-
up,
we
conservatively
assumed
that
the
values
at
the
post-treatment and six month follow-up assessments were iden-
tical to those at baseline.
As Roland and Morris disability questionnaire score is a
skewed, non-normal distribution, we used the Wilcoxon rank
sum test to assess the difference between the two groups.
9 We
used the non-parametric jack-knife method to calculate 95%
confidence intervals.
10 We used analysis of covariance to assess
the differences and 95% confidence intervals between the two
groups in visual analogue scale pain scores and pain scores
measured by the core outcome measures and Oswestry disability
questionnaire, with adjustment for pretreatment score alone or
together with other possible baseline variables such as duration
of low back pain.
9 We used logistic regression models to estimate
the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of having
significant disability as measured by the Roland and Morris dis-
ability questionnaire, with adjustment for pretreatment score
alone or together with other possible baseline variables. We
applied cumulative logit models to the ordinal property of
disability
defined
by
Oswestry
disability
questionnaire
to
estimate incremental odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
11
We used SAS version 9 for statistical analyses.
Results
The figure shows a summary of enrolment, randomisation, loss
to
follow-up,
and
assessment.
Two
participants
in
the
acupressure group and five in the physical therapy group
refused to receive the designated intervention. Two participants
in each group switched to receive the treatment of the opposite
group. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics in the two treat-
ment groups; no differences existed in demographic, educa-
tional, or occupational aspects.
Roland and Morris disability questionnaire
The mean total Roland and Morris disability questionnaire score
after treatment was significantly lower in the acupressure group
than in the physical therapy group, regardless of the difference in
absolute score ( −3.8, 95% confidence interval −5.7 to −1.9) or
mean change from baseline ( −4.64, −6.39 to −2.89) (table 2).
Acupressure conferred an 89% (95% confidence interval 61% to
97%) reduction in significant disability compared with physical
therapy after adjustment for degree of disability at baseline. The
mean difference in total score between the two groups after
treatment
remained
statistically
significant
(P < 0.05)
after
adjustment for pretreatment score or disability together with
other baseline characteristics shown in table 1.
Given the difference in rate of significant disability (table 2),
the estimated number needed to be treated with acupressure to
reduce cases with severe disability by one was 5.98. As seen in
table 2, the improvement in Roland and Morris disability
questionnaire score in the acupressure group compared with the
physical group still remained at the six month follow-up. The
number needed to treat with acupressure was 9.31.
Core outcome measures and visual analogue scale
After adjustment for pretreatment score (comparison 1 in table
3), the differences in mean scores for core outcome measures in
the acupressure group were significantly different from those in
the physical therapy group. Mean scores were lower in the
acupressure group for the items “low back pain,” “leg pain,” “pain
interferes with normal work,” “days cut down on doing things,”
and “days off from work/school.” Mean scores were higher in the
acupressure group for the items “satisfaction of life with the
symptoms” and “satisfaction with previous treatment.” The mean
scores for the pain visual scale and sleeping with low back pain

were lower in the acupressure group than in the physical therapy
group. The differences between the two groups remained statis-
tically significant (P < 0.05) after adjustment for pretreatment
score and other baseline characteristics. In terms of mean
change from baseline, the benefit was also greater in the
acupressure group for all variables (comparison 2 in table 3).
The statistically significant improvement remained or even
increased at the six month follow-up (table 3).
Modified Oswestry disability questionnaire
The mean total Oswestry disability questionnaire score after
treatment was significantly lower in the acupressure group than
in the physical therapy group, regardless of the difference in
absolute score ( −5.34, −7.62 to −3.05) or mean change from
baseline ( −6.81, −9.49 to −4.12) (table 4). As regards disability
classified by five grades, the odds ratio of increasing one grade of
disability was 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.48;
P = 0.0001) for the acupressure group. The differences between
the two groups remained significant (P < 0.05) after adjustment
for pretreatment score or disability in conjunction with other
baseline characteristics.
Given the difference in rate of significant disability between
the two groups (table 4), the estimated number needed to treat
with acupressure to reduce the degree of disability by one grade
was 6.15. As seen in table 4, the improvement in Oswestry
disability
questionnaire
score
in
the
acupressure
group
compared with the physical group remained at the six month
follow-up. The number needed to treat with acupressure was
4.58.

Discussion
This study shows that acupressure is more efficacious in alleviat-
ing low back pain than is physical therapy, as measured by pain
visual analogue scale, core outcome measures, Roland and Mor-
ris disability questionnaire, and Oswestry disability question-
naire. The results support the conclusion of the previous
randomised controlled clinical trial on low back pain treated by
acupressure.
5 Acupressure may thus be useful for reducing pain
and improving body function and level of disability in low back
pain.
Outcome measures used
Most of the domains of the core outcome measures were able to
distinguish the difference between the acupressure group and
the physical therapy group, irrespective of absolute change or
mean change from baseline at post-treatment and six month
follow-up
assessments.
The
Roland
and
Morris
disability
questionnaire
has
been
considered
an
outcome
measure
sensitive to changes in clinical status for the study of low back
pain.
12 13 In our study, we saw statistically significant treatment
differences with this questionnaire. Results for the Oswestry dis-
ability questionnaire score also showed functional improvement
with acupressure irrespective of whether the score was classified
into five ordinal categories or modified by a simple summation
scoring method.
14
The World Health Organization recommended that the
visual analogue scale should be included as an outcome measure
in all studies on low back pain,
15 so we included this measure in
the study. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint of patients
with low back pain, and we included it as a reference indicator; it
showed a significant difference between the two groups in abso-
lute change and mean change from baseline at the post-
treatment and six month follow-up assessments.
Limitations of the study
Three concerns about the study should be clarified. Firstly, the
efficacy of acupressure in pain relief might be attributed to a psy-

chological effect emerging between patients and therapist
during therapy. However, we believe that such a confounding
effect caused by interaction or a doctor-patient relationship is
unlikely to affect the results, because people who seek physical
therapy generally have a strong desire for orthodox/Western
medicine, the therapists in both groups were blind to the results
of pretreatment assessments, and the use of Roland and Morris
disability questionnaire and Oswestry disability questionnaire
was mainly to assess functional status and disability, which should
be less affected by the psychological effect than subjective meas-
ures of pain.
Secondly, 20 (15.5%) patients were lost to follow-up at six
months. We do not believe that this would have had much influ-
ence on the result. However, the problem might be ameliorated
by using an intention to treat method that included patients lost
to follow-up in the analysis. As mentioned before, we substituted
missing data for patients lost to follow-up with baseline or post-
treatment data by assuming no change since last contact.
Finally, the effectiveness of any manipulation therapy is
highly dependent on the therapist’s technique and experience.
The selection of treatment modality and technique to be applied
to patients depended on the discretion of the therapist for both
physical therapy and acupressure, even though standardised
procedures were established. Ensuring comparability between
treatments is therefore important. For physical therapy, this
should not be a serious problem because the technique has been
well established in orthodox/Western medicine. We avoided
variation across practitioners for acupressure by using only one
therapist. The use of a single therapist may enhance internal
validity but also imposes a threat to external validity. We hope
that this technique can be imparted to other therapists now that
its efficacy has been shown in our study, so that acupressure can
be
used
in
other
populations. How
acupressure
can
be
generalised to patients with low back pain is the subject of ongo-
ing research.
Conclusions
This randomised controlled clinical trial has shown the efficacy
of acupressure compared with physical therapy in pain relief for
patients with low back pain in terms of disability, pain scores, and
functional status. The results provide a base for comparison
across international studies.
