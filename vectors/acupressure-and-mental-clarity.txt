TEFILLIN: AN ANCIENT
ACUPUNCTURE POINT
PRESCRIPTION FOR
MENTAL CLARITY

Introduction
Tefillin is an ancient Jewish prayer ritual that uses two small
leather boxes, each attached to a long, 9mm wide, leather
strap. One box is placed on the biceps of the weaker arm
while the second is placed on the head. The biceps strap is
tightly wound along the arm in a carefully prescribed
manner. The back of the head strap is tied in a knot and
carefully placed at the base of the skull.
The acknowledged purpose of the tefillin is to raise
spiritual consciousness of the men who wear it. If we
examine where the knots and wrappings are placed from a
TCM point of view, it appears that the tefillin and wraps
form a potent acupuncture point formula focused on the
Governing vessel (Du Mai) and aimed at elevating the spirit
and clearing the mind.
The head tefillin
The head tefillin is the simplest to examine as its positioning
is very explicitly defined. The box is always placed midway
between the eyes with the base of the tefillin placed on the
forehead so the bottom edge remains just inside the hair-
line. The diagram below shows this location as Shenting
DU-24. The weight of the box (several ounces) is a little
further back at Shangxing DU-23; the exact placement of
weight will vary slightly depending on the size of the box.
The knot in the back (where the strap is tied together) is placed
just under the external occipital protuberance. This corre-
sponds to Fengfu DU-16. Once the knot is in place, the side
straps are tightened down. This creates a steady upward
pressure into Fengfu DU-16 and more pressure on both
Shangxing DU-23 and Shenting DU-24.
Binding the left arm
I explored the four major variations in wrapping proce-
dures: Chassidic1, Sefardim2, Sefard, and Ashkenazi3. By
experimenting on myself with these different wrapping
procedures, I was able to map out the significant acupunc-
ture points that are stimulated through the procedure (see
over page).
Point Selection for Analysis
Along with the three skull points already discussed, the
tefillin wrap contacts a good number of the over 50 acu-
puncture points on the arm6. However, we will limit our
point analysis to those that have a more substantive influ-
ence on the mind and spirit7. In addition, because the
pressure of the arm wrap is mostly felt at points on the

outside of the arm bones we have excluded general points
on the Pericardium and Triple Burner channel. That leaves
us with the points shown on the Tables to the right. The
points are listed in the order in which they are initially
stimulated.

L.I.-4 and the Pericardium channel (from wrapping the
middle finger) always have more stimulation than others.
Also, wrist points including Taiyuan LU-9 and Shenmen
HE-7 receive stronger pressure compared to the other points
on the body of the forearm. Thus a more honed formula of
the more significant points is as follows:
Chassidic: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen
HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium
channel.
Ashkenazi: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen
HE-7, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium channel.
Sefard: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen
HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium
channel.
Sefardim:Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen
HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium
channel.
Note that there is essential agreement and overlap be-
tween the honed point prescriptions called for by the four
different tefillin wrapping techniques.  The only difference
is that the the Ashkenazi style excludes Taiyuan LU-9. This
should have little clinical significance, given the scope of
the remaining points in the formula.
Point and channel discussion
• The Governing Vessel (Du Mai) is an extra-ordinary
meridian that runs up the spine and penetrates the brain. It
is well known for its ability to treat psychiatric disorders
and influence the mind8. The Spiritual action of points on
the Governing vessel can be explained because it has the
closest relationship with the brain, which, according to pre-
Inner Classic and later Daoist traditions is considered to be
the seat of the spirit. A further connection of the Governing
Vessel to Spirit is found from its anterior pathway, which
directly connects it to the more traditional home of Spirit,
the Heart.
• Fengfu DU-16 (Wind Mansion) is also known as Gui Zhen,
which translates as Ghost Pillow9. It has also a point in the
Window of Heaven category10. According to channel theory,
Fengfu DU-16 is where the Governing vessel penetrates the
brain. It is one of two points (the other being Baihui DU-20)
that directly nurture the brain and spinal cord. The thera-
peutic scope of Fengfu DU-16 is quite wide and it is known
to strongly benefit both concentration and memory. It also
treats dizziness, stroke, aphasia and headache. In psychotic
patients, it reduces the desire for suicide and for self-
mutilation. Fengfu DU-16 is also is a point on Yang Linking
vessel that connects all heavenly rising Yang energy.
• Shangxing DU-23 (Upper Star) is also known as Gui Tang
which translates as Ghost Hall. It treats psychosis, head-
aches, and nearsightedness. It is also the root of the sinus
and is very effective in treating loss of smell. Since the
olfactory nerve is the first of the 12 cranial nerves, its use in
this manner clearly indicates a profound effect on the brain.
• Shenting DU-24 (Spirit Court) is also known as Tianting
(Courtyard of Heaven) calms the mind and balances the
spirit. It can be used to treat any mental disease11. Like other
points of the Governing vessel, it has a strong action on
calming the spirit and treating epilepsy and other mania
disorders. According to Daoist tradition, this point can
connect directly to Niwan (Mud Ball), which is considered
to be the location of the physical basis of the spirit. “The qi
of the Heart is connected with the Niwan Palace above.”12
The significance of Niwan, also known as Huangting (Yel-
low Courtyard) is emphasized in the Classic on the Central
Void in the Inner Sphere which said, “The origin of essence-
spirit in the brain is also called Niwan” and also “The entire
spirit that expresses in the face has its origin in Niwan”.13
• Houxi SI-3 (Back Ravine) is the most important point on the
hand with respect to the mind because it is the opening
point to the Governing vessel. It frees and moves qi in the
Governing vessel and acts as a multiplier that strengthens
the actions of the vessel’s points (Fengfu DU-16, Shangxing
DU-23 and Shenting DU-24) already stimulated by the head
tefillin. Alone or in combination with other points, it clears
the spirit, treats any kind of psychosis including loss of
memory, dementia, sorrow or fear.
• Zhizheng SI-7 (Branch of the Upright) is the luo connecting
point of the Small Intestine channel, connecting to the Heart
channel. It has a pronounced effect on regulating and
calming the shen. It helps relieve anxiety, fear and sorrow.
• Hegu L.I.-4 (Union Valley) is the command point of the
head and face. It is used to treat all conditions of the head,
face, sinuses or eyes. It has a powerful calming and anti-
spasmodic effect and is widely used in relieving pain. It has
a strong influence on the mind and has the ability to soothe
the mind and calm anxieties. It is widely used in combina-
tion with other points because it strongly enhances the

movement of qi and strengthens the effect of other points in
the point formula.
• Pianli LI-6 (Veering Passage) and Wenliu LI-7 (Warm
Flow) are both used together to treat any mental disorder,
and in particular, improve the clarity of the spirit.
• Tianfu LU-3 (Heavenly Residence) is the first point stimu-
lated when one starts the process of wrapping the tefillin. It
is an important point in treating the mind and is in a special
point category called Window of Heaven points. The points
in this grouping all have psychological and spiritual ben-
efits.
• Chize LU-5 (Cubit Marsh, aka Gui Tang: Ghost Hall) treats
panic and anxiety. As a Ghost point, it has the effect of clearing
the mind and enhancing concentration. It can promote qi and
blood circulation in the head and face.14All wrap techniques
except Ashkenazi intersect and stimulate this point
• Lieque LU-7 (Broken Sequence) is the command point of
the head and neck and it is capable of improving circulation
in the brain. Its primary mental function is related to stimu-
lating memory. It is both the Luo point to the Lung channel
connecting to the Large Intestine channel and also the
opening point for the Conception vessel.
• Taiyuan LU-9 (Great Abysss aka Gui Xia: Ghost Heart) is
the yuan-source of the Lung channel. It treats agitation and
is very calming to the mind.
• Shaohai HE-3 (Lesser Sea) improves memory and de-
creases fears and anxiety.
• Shenmen HE-7 (Spirit Gate) treats all mental disorders
equally well. It is a primary point to calm the heart and
mind, balance the spirit and improve memory and concen-
tration. Because Lingdao HE-4, Tongli HE-5, Yinxi HE-6
and Shenmen HE-7 are located very close together, windings
like the Chassid technique for the lower arm are more likely
to stimulate all of these points.
• The Pericardium Channel calms the heart and steadies the
mind. Even though no specific points are stimulated, the
wrapping of the middle finger stimulates this channel in
general. The Sephardim wrap stimulates this channel the
strongest.
Discussion
If someone handed an acupuncturist the above point for-
mula and asked what was being treated, there is little doubt
that mental and shen issues would be a strong part of the
pattern. What is surprising is that such a point formula
would be found in a non-Chinese procedure that has been
continuously practised for many thousands of years. It may
be that the originators of the tefillin ritual had some inkling
of its special effects, even though they may have lacked the
depth and specific knowledge we have today.
The order of wrapping is also very interesting in that the
entire arm is not wrapped at once, but stopped prior to
stimulating the hand points of the Pericardium Channel as
well as Houxi SI-3 and Hegu L.I.-4. These points are added
only after Fengfu DU-16, Shangxing DU-23 and Shenting
DU-24 have been added to the point formula. Perhaps this
is a subtle clue to our present day practice of acupuncture,
recommending to us that we add the point multipliers
towards the end of our treatment protocol. This concept
deserves further exploration.
Regardless of the belief system behind the procedure, it
seems clear that putting on tefillin is a unique way of stimu-
lating a very precise set of acupuncture points that appears
designed to clear the mind and harmonise the spirit.
