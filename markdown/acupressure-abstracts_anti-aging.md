It is well established that the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes are composed of
long arrays of (TTAGGG)n x (CCCTAA)n that form a nucleoprotein complex required
for the replication and protection of chromosome ends. Throughout the cell cycle,
telomeres also contain a protein component related to the proto-oncogene Myb that is
known as TRF1 (telomere TTAGGG repeat binding factor 1) that binds to the duplex
array of TTAGGG repeats in the telomere. Previous studies have shown that TRF1
appears to play a role in controlling the length of telomeres by acting as an inhibitor of
telomerase. The amount of each of the TRF1(C-19) & TRF1(N-19) was identical to the
amount of telomere of the same organ of the same apparently normal individual. Using
synthesized basic unit of TTAGGG, as well as CCCTAA, as separate reference control
substances for the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test of Resonance Phenomenon between 2
identical substances, we were able to non-invasively measure the approximate amount
of TTAGGG and CCCTAA units, in both normal and cancerous human cells. We
examined about 30 apparently normal subjects (both Asian and Caucasian in both sex).
The subjects' ages ranged from infancy to 76 years. Each subject was first examined
using TTAGGG as a control substance and then examined using CCCTAA as a control
substance. The amount of telomere in various cancer tissues are almost always higher
than that of normal tissue of the same organ. The measured amounts of both TTAGGG
and CCCTAA were found to be in an average of 1500-1600 ng for human fetus or
infancy and decreased with the advance of age in both sex with the exception of the
heart, brain, eyes (retina), testes, and ovaries, which usually remain at the level of the
infant, or reduced very little. Individuals in the same age group had a similar range of
amounts of both TTAGGG and CCCTAA in the same organ of the same individual,
(except for those with unusually low telomeres often had chronic degenerative diseases,
and those who had exceptionally high telomere levels often had excellent physical
conditions or mental acumen).


The amounts of measured TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules before and after acupuncture on
St. 36 in adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma coexisting in the lung of a 54-yr.-old Asian
male were: telomere in adenocarcinoma decreased from 950 ng to 750 ng and telomere in small
cell carcinoma decreased from 770 ng to 600 ng. When the cancer treatment is effective, the
amount of telomere is reduced towards the value of the normal internal organ. **We found that**
**acupuncture on St.36 on apparently normal subjects increased the telomere levels up to a**
**maximum of more than 2 times their telomere levels prior to the treatment, depending on**
**the method of treatment, but frequently increases were between 60% to 100%. Strong**
**Shiatsu performed on St. 36 produced a somewhat lesser effect than acupuncture.** We also
determined the amounts of TTAGGG and CCCTAA molecules non-invasively in 3 mummified
Egyptian sisters from the 8th Century BC on exhibit at the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy in order
to estimate their approximate ages (at the time of death). The amounts of body telomere were
500 ng, 550 ng, and 750 ng. For the prehistoric Iceman (about 3350 B.C. to 3310 B.C)
discovered in 1991 in the Italian Otzal Alps at about 3,200 meters altitude, estimated body
telomere was about 400 ng and telomere in brain and heart was 1600 ng, similar to that of a
contemporary human being. Although these studies are preliminary, the findings may have
**potential applications not only in anti-aging**, cancer treatments, and pathophysiology of brain
and heart, but also for the estimation of the difference in the ages of cadavers studied in
archeology and forensic medicine.
