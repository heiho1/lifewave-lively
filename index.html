            <h1>Healing with Light</h1>
            <p>
                As a wushu coach and lifelong student of combative arts, I have experienced many training-related 
                injuries over the years.
                The accumulation of these injuries led to constant pain that was a nagging presence.
                I had for a long time been aware of chromatherapy and the healing properties of light, particularly light
                in the infra-red spectrum.  
                Perhaps a year ago I was introduced to the Lightwave X39 patch.  Based on the principles of
                photobiomodulation, this patch is designed to stimulate the body's natural healing processes
                through the application of specific wavelengths of light.  
                As the technology was something I could envision as a possibility, I decided to give the patch a test
                on my own injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time I had two nagging injuries that had lasted for over a year.  One was to the shoulder from
                some jujitsu-related practice and the other was a foot that I had broken by wearing the wrong pair of
                shoes on an impromptu mountain hike.  
                As an experiment, I applied the patch initially to the right foot which was on a 1-10 pain scale, 
                about a regular 7.  After a week of the patch being applied, the pain level decreased to about a 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Encouraged by this result, I then applied a patch to my injured left elbow.  After about a week 
                the pain in the elbow decreased to non-perceptible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone who has trained in combative arts and experienced injuries from training knows that 
                injuries can and will happen.  To be able to apply a non-invasive method to accelerate healing
                and alleviate pain is a great benefit.  Relative to the cost of medication and potential greater 
                cost of so-called side-effects, the cost of a patch that has no contra-indications and no side-effects
                is simply a hands-down better choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently I tweaked my should practicing throws.  The pain lasted a few days and was annoying.  I put a
                patch on the shoulder and within two days it was fine as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                To date, the injuries mentioned above are a fading memory.  That alone was worth the time spent.
                I do not normally offer products.  I would only ever offer something that I have personally
                tested and found to be effective.  The Lightwave X39 patch is one such product.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a software engineer, I wanted to condense the knowledge gained in clinical trials and experimental
                research of the Lifewave X39 into a context where people can ask reasonable questions and get authoritative
                responses based on actual science.  The evidence associated with phototherapy, the root technology behind 
                Lifewave patch products, is well documented and the clinical trials associated with the X39 patch are
                publicly available.  To promote the spread of a beneficial technology by enabling users to learn more in an
                interactive way, I have created this chat interface.   The chat only knows about X39 because that is the only
                product I have personally tested.  This is not to say that you, gentle reader, should not explore the full
                range of possibilities offered by Lifewave.  To engage the chat you can click the small chat bubble in the 
                lower-right corner of this page.
