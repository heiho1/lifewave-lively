AIM: Insomnia is a major problem which decreases life quality. Many causes are involved with
it and anxiety is often associated. The underlying mechanism is not completely understood, even
though different factors seem to be associated. Among them melatonin and its circadian rhythm
is thought to have an important role. In addition, acupressure and acupuncture are known to
ameliorate insomnia and anxiety, when a specific wrist point is stimulated (HT 7 Shenmen).
With these bases, the aim of the present study has been to evaluate the efficacy of an acupressure
device, ''H7-insomnia control'', positioned on HT 7 points, during the night, in terms of general
health and anxiety levels, together with the evaluation of sleep quality and the urinary melatonin
metabolite 6-hydroxymelatonin sulphate determination, in a number of insomniacs. METHODS:
Forty patients with insomnia were divided into two groups and randomly received either the H7
or placebo treatments, in a double-blind protocol, for 20 nights. Before and after treatments
every subject answered a series of questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire 28 items; StateTrait Anxiety Inventory; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and collected 24 h urines, divided into
two samples of 12 h each. Urinary melatonin metabolite was then determined using a RIA

method. RESULTS: Data obtained indicate that the device H7-insomnia control **is efficacious to**

**ameliorate quality of sleep and reduce anxiety levels in insomniacs,** at a higher extent than in
the placebo group. In addition, the 24 hours urinary melatonin metabolite rhythm, obtained at the
end of treatment, was considered as being normal in a higher percentage of H7-treated patients,
with respect to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: It is plausible to hypothesize that the wrist
acupressure device might be considered a valid tool, without adverse effects since it does not
contain pharmaceutical products, that is able to naturally ameliorate sleep quality in insomniacs,
acting through a not jet completely clarified mechanism, that may involve melatonin.

AIM: The induction of sleep would depend on interaction between gabaergic system
and the pineal gland through its main hormone melatonin. Until few years ago
benzodiazepines were the only drugs effective in the treatment of insomnia. Recently,
however, both melatonin and acupressure have appear to be active in sleep disorders.
The aim of study was to evaluate the efficacy of HT 7 point acupressure in insomnia.
METHODS: The study enrolled 25 patients affected by sleep disorders, 14 of whom had
a neoplastic disease. They were treated by HT 7 stimulation for al least two consecutive
weeks using a medical device named H7 Insomnia Control. RESULTS: An
improvement in the quality of sleep was achieved in 15/25 (60%) patients, with a more
evident efficacy in cancer patients (11/14 [79%]). CONCLUSION: This study confirms
previous clinical data showing the efficacy of acupressure in the treatment of sleep
disorders, particularly in cancer-related insomnia.

BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese acupressure is a noninvasive technique that employs
pressure and massage to acupoints in order to stimulate the balance of life energy that promotes
health and comfort. Sleep disturbance is common in patients with end-stage renal disease but no
intervention studies have addressed this problem. Aim. The purpose of the present study was to
test the effectiveness of acupoints massage for patients with end-stage renal disease and
experiencing sleep disturbances and diminished quality of life. METHODS: The study was a
randomized control trial. A total of 98 end-stage renal disease patients with sleep disturbances
were randomly assigned into an acupressure group, a sham acupressure group, and a control
group. Acupressure and sham acupressure group patients received acupoints or no acupoints
massage three times a week during haemodialysis treatment for a total of 4 weeks. The measures
included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Sleep Log, and the Medical Outcome Study - Short
Form 36. FINDINGS: The results indicated significant differences between the acupressure
group and the control group in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index subscale scores of subjective sleep
quality, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep sufficiency, and global Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index scores. Sleep log data revealed that the acupressure group significantly decreased
wake time and experienced an improved quality of sleep at night over the control group. Medical
Outcome Study - Short Form 36 data also documented that acupressure group patients
experienced significantly improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: This study supports the
**effectiveness of acupoints massage in improving the quality of sleep** and life quality of endstage renal disease patients, and offers a noninvasive therapy for sleep-disturbed patients.

BACKGROUND: Elderly people often suffer from disturbed sleep. Because traditional Chinese
medicine indicates that acupressure therapy may induce sedation, testing the effectiveness of
acupressure in enhancing the quality of sleep of institutionalized residents with a well-designed
scientific study is needed. METHODS: A randomized block experimental design was used. The
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire was used as a screening tool to select
subjects with sleep disturbance. By matching the effects of hypertension, hypnosis, naps, and
exercise, subjects were randomly assigned to an acupressure group, a sham acupressure group,
and a control group. Each group had 28 subjects for a total of 84 subjects. The same massage
routine was used in the acupressure group and the sham acupressure group, whereas only
conversation was employed in the control group. RESULTS: There were significant differences
in PSQI subscale scores of the quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances of sleep, and
global PSQI scores among subjects in the three groups before and after interventions.
Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the frequencies of nocturnal awakening and
night wakeful time in the acupressure group compared to the other two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the **effectiveness of acupressure in improving the**
**quality of sleep of elderly people** and offered a nonpharmacological therapy method for sleepdisturbed elderly people.
