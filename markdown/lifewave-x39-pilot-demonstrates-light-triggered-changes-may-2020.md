**Abstract**

_**Purpose**_ **-** To determine if metabolic and physiological changes were produced by participants
wearing the LifeWave non-transdermal X39 phototherapy patch.
_**Materials -**_ LifeWave X39 non-transdermal patches, Sabre Sciences urine and saliva test kits.
Amino Acid panel was performed using a TSQ Quantum Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS Mass
Spectrometer. Adrenal stress panel, cortisol and DHEAS, from saliva were performed using a
Sciex 4000 Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS Mass Spectrometer and Dynex DSX 4-plate
automated ELISA processing system respectively. Physiology testing was done using a
Thought Technology Biograph Infinity Physiology Suite with Cardio Pro software. Blood
pressure was taken with a Model #BPAG1-20CVS monitor. Questionnaires included: MarlowCrowne, Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale for Vitality, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, McGill
Pain Scale, WAIS III- memory subtest, Profile of Mood States.
_**Method**_ **-** Fifteen subjects of convenience age 40-65 were recruited through flyers and email.
Subjects were consented and baseline measures were taken. Patches were worn 8-12 hours
each day placed at either the GV14 or CV6 acupuncture points as selected by a computerized
algorithm and selected for ease and clarity of patch placement for participants. All measures
were taken at all test points: Baseline/day1, day 2 and day 7. Participants were asked to apply
patch one hour prior to testing on day 2 and 7.
Cortisol levels were obtained from 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm and 12am time collection saliva
Samples were purified with Phenomenex Strata polymeric reversed phase columns and
analyzed on Sciex 4000 Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS Mass Spectrometer using Phenomenex
Kinetex C8 3x100mm, 2.6um, 100A column with linear gradient.
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels were obtained at 8am, 8pm and 12am time
collections using Pantex salivary cortisol ELISA kit on Dynex DSX 4-plate automated ELISA
processing system.
Urine samples were taken by 10am at each test point. WAIS III data was taken immediately,
at 10 minutes and at 20 minutes. A full 10 number sequence was used which was randomly
generated for each subject at each data point. Amino acid analysis was obtained on TSQ
Quantum Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS Mass Spectrometer using Phenomenex EzFaast amino
acid kit.
_**Results -**_ Significant changes were seen in most essential and nonessential amino acids over
the period of one week. These changes include:

1. Changes of inflammatory markers and their metabolites
2. Improvement in sleep quality
3. Reduction in blood pressure
4. Improvement in short term memory
5. Improvement in reported feelings of vitality
_**Conclusion -**_ While this is a small sample of convenience the positive results in this study
suggest that further investigation needs to be done. Both the effect that appears to produce a
number of significant amino acid changes in a short period of time and the improvement in short
term memory which are particularly relevant to an ageing population and should be explored.


Keywords: Photobiology, Phototherapy, Meridian

**Introduction**

The X39 patch uses phototherapy to stimulate the tripeptides GHK and GHK- Cu (Connor et al,
May 2020). This tripeptide (glycine, histidine, and lysine) was first isolated in 1973 by Dr. Loren
Pickart. This is important as the “copper tripeptide-1 belongs to a group of emergency response
molecules which are released during injury and come to the body’s aid...” (DeHaven, C., 2014)
It is naturally released by the body when there is any type of injury to tissue. For example: the
“copper tripeptide-1 has been suggested to have a potential therapeutic role in age-related
neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. It improves axon survival and maintenance of nerves.”
(DeHaven, C., 2014)
This pilot study explores the metabolic and physiologic results of wearing the LifeWave nontransdermal patch over the period of one week. Measures were taken at baseline, 24 hours and
at 7 days of wearing the patch. A sample of convenience of 15 subjects made up of both men
and women aged 40-65 were selected to participate in this study. Study approval from National
Foundation for Energy Healing number NFFEH 8-28-18-07.

**Non-transdermal Patch**

The LifeWave patch is non-transdermal. This means that instead of having chemicals imbedded
in the patch and intended to be absorbed, nothing contained within the sealed patch enters the
body. Instead, this allows the light to flow through the patch without any changes to the contents
of the patch throughout the time the patch is worn.

**Phototherapy**

Phototherapy uses light to promote changes in the body. The patch uses infrared, light, near
infrared light, and visible spectrum light passing through specially processed crystals in solution
to send out specific wave lengths that facilitate those changes. The LifeWave patches help to
stimulate the body by using that light to create physiological effects. In the past 100 years, in
repeated trials of various phototherapy products, there has been only rare reported incidents of
negative side effects.

**Meridian Implications and Patch placement**

LifeWave patches are placed on specific meridian points to maximize effectiveness. The theory
of balancing the body based on the Chinese meridian system is over 3000 years old. Current
information now maps the meridian system to parts of the lymphatic system. The concept of the

release of “Qi” on an area of the lymphatic system is consistent with the evidence that the body
has a variety of electrical-dermal potentials across its surface (Becker & Selden, 1985, Flick,
2004).
There are two options which were selected for patch placement. The first GV14 effects Yang
meridians of the body, which helps prevent illness. It also clears heat, which would include
inflammation and redness, which is a common sign of tissue damage. (Deadman, P., 2001)
The second option CV-6, supports the Kidneys and harmonizes blood. (Deadman, P., 2001)
Computer randomization was used with half the participants using the CV6 point and half using
the GV14 point.

**Metabolic test Panel**

It is well known fact that this tripeptide glycine-histidine-lysine (GHK) has the ability to bind on
the cell surface and transmit copper in and out of cells, which may help copper enzyme
activities, including phenol oxidase, alanine synthase, tyrosinase, and cytochrome oxidase.
The purpose of this study is to follow the production of tripeptide glycine-histidine-lysine (GHK),
its degradation into glycine, histidine and lysine amino acids, the relation to glutathione
production, and their metabolic effect.
We have selected the Sabre Sciences HPA4 metabolic panel **, which** involves urine and
saliva collection. The urine testing evaluates all 22 natural amino acids, in addition their
metabolites including major inflammatory markers such as glutathione, cysteine to cystine ratio,
homocysteine and homocystine ratio.
This test also determines level of neurotransmitters and their intermediates including 5-HTP,
Serotonin, Dopamine, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, GABA, Glutamic acid, Histamine, L-DOPA,
Normetanephrine, Metanephrine, and 3-Methoxytyramine. The salivary testing evaluates
adrenal hormones such as cortisol and DHEAS.
Metabolic testing consisted of one 10am urine taken at baseline/day one, day two and day
seven. Saliva Testing consisted of six swabs taken in one day at baseline/day one, day two and
seven. Subjects self-administered the swab when in the laboratory under the supervision of Dr.
Connor. The swab was then placed back in the shipping container and labeled with the subject
number. Samples were kept in the freezer at -20F and were shipped to the Sabre Sciences
laboratory in Carlsbad, CA on a daily basis.

**Physiology Suite**

In this study the initial baseline readings were taken, and then the X39 patch was applied. The
participant was asked to wear the patch 8-12 hours each day. The participant removed the
patch at night and a fresh patch was applied each morning prior to 8 am. The patch was worn
for a minimum of 1 hour before the additional data measures were taken. Patches were worn for
a total of 7 days. Data taking with the patch applied was done on day one, day two and day

seven.
All study participants had the following physiological testing done at base line, day 2 (24
hours) and 7 days: Six minute recordings of EKG, pulse, respiration, heart rate variability (HRV),
temp, blood volume pulse, galvanic skin response, and 2 EMG (muscle) leads (one on each
shoulder area). At baseline testing, participants were checked for any allergic reactions to the
adhesive used on patches. No participants in this study had a reaction to the patch adhesive.

**Questionnaires**

A series of questionnaires were administered to support the metabolic findings.

_**- The Marlowe Crowne**_ is a 13 Item true/false short form that is a measure of subjects’
tendencies to give answers that they may perceive are desired by the interviewer and/or reflect
perceived positive social norms. This variable can produce inaccurate or misleading findings
unless properly controlled for in statistical analysis. Estimated completion time 2 minutes. This
instrument was normed by Reynolds in 1982.

_**- The McGill Pain Scale**_ is comprised of three sections regarding a subject’s pain. Section
number one asks, “What Does Your Pain Feel Like?” and then lists 20 descriptive categories
that are numerically rated as 1 – 5. Section number two asks, “How Does Your Pain Change
with Time?” The first question asks the subject to describe the pattern of their pain; and this is
followed by 22 descriptive terms regarding their effects on increasing or decreasing pain. The
third section reflects upon the strength of the pain and has six questions that give a context and
comparison to the current pain compared to other types of pain suffered in the past. Again this
section is ranked numerically 1-5, with one being mild and five being excruciating. (Melzack, R.,
1975)

_**- The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index**_ is comprised of a mix of quantitative questions and five
Likert scale questions 0-3. It explores the type and quality of sleep experienced by an individual
over the past month. It was normed by Cole et al. (2006). (normed is correctly used, can’t get
spellcheck to accept it)

_**- The Arizona Integrative Outcome Scale, Visual Analogue Scale (AIOS-VAS)**_ _**for Vitality**_
rates subject’s “overall sense of well-being and vitality” over the past 24 hours, using a 100mm
one-line visual analogue scale. This instrument was normed by Bell in 2004.

_**- The Profile of Mood States (POMS)**_ is a 37-item 5 factor scale which is a basic measure of
affective state in several dimensions including vigor, mood, anxiety and depression. 8 minutes
maximum completion time. It was normed by McNair et al., 1971/1981; Shacham, 1983.

_**- The WAS III**_
A subsection of the WAS III, the memory subtest was used to determine level of short, mid and
long-term memory and if there is an improvement in memory from baseline to 7 days.

**Participants**

A sample of convenience of individuals who responded to locally placed flyers consisted of 15
individuals. There were five men and 10 women in the study which had a mean age of 61.9 ±
9.3 years.

**Statistical Analysis**

Data from questionnaires were collected on standard answer sheets and scored. Then the data
points were entered into an excel spread sheet for statistical evaluation. Standardized tests
were scored and reviewed for data trends and significant results. All questionnaires parameters
were summarized in terms of means and standard deviation, stratified by assessment time
point. Changes between assessment time points were evaluated using a paired t-test or
nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. All physiology parameters were summarized in
terms of means and standard deviation, stratified across the 6 study epochs. Changes from
pre- to post-patch administration were evaluated using a paired t-test. Normal probability plots
were examined to verify the distribution assumptions. All reported P-values are two-sided and
P<0.05 was used to define statistical significance. All metabolic parameters were summarized in
terms of means and standard deviation, stratified by assessment time point. Changes from day

1 (pre-patch) to day 2, day 2 to day 7, and day 1 to day 7 were evaluated using a paired t-test or
nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Cortisol levels were obtained at 8am, 12pm, 4pm,
8pm and 12am.
DHEAS levels were measured from 8am, 8pm and 12am collection times. The area under the
curve (AUC) for Cortisol and DHEAS levels over the data collection periods were calculated
using the trapezoid rule. AUC levels were summarized in terms of means and standard
deviations, stratified by assessment time point. Changes between assessment time points were
evaluated using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test.

**Results**

Significant results of the X39 patch testing are as follows:

The Marlowe-Crowne looks at social desirability. It is used to measure the reliability of the data.
One common confounding variable in research is research subjects telling the researchers the
answers they think the researchers want. The middle range that is being shown here suggests
that this was not an issue with this particular group. It is also interesting that this group had a
non-significant negative mean change, indicating that the responders became more honest.

The AIOS-VAS looks at the overall wellness of an individual. In this case there was a clear, though not
quite significant positive shift established by the second day of testing. It had increased to significance
by day 7 showing clear overall improvement in the feelings of vitality and wellness.

Memory is a common issue for people above age 45. The WAIS III is a well-established
intelligence test which includes a standard memory test. There was a clear trend, though not
significant, improvement in short term memory by day 7. It is likely that this would get more
significant with a larger group of people and a longer intervention period. It is also interesting
that there was improvement in both mid and long-term memory as well, though to a much lower
degree. Further research should be done in this specific area as a non-invasive support to
memory as one ages has the potential to be of benefit to many individuals.

The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index was used to look at sleep, which is also a common issue
once people get past 45. This questionnaire showed an immediate strong shift the first night,
though it was not quite significant. The shift by day 7 was significant. This is particularly
important as sleep strongly effects everything else related to health and wellbeing.
There were no significant changes in the Profile of Mood States and the McGill Pain scores
from the baseline (pre-patch) assessment to the close of the study.

Amino acids and neurotransmitters play a critical role in the health and wellbeing of
individuals. If an individual’s amino acid and neurotransmitter production pathways are
imbalanced, the individual cannot maintain body health for long.
The number of statistically significant changes demonstrated in this study shows the powerful
impact which can be created by the use of phototherapy products and the clear positive

changes produced by the application of this specific non-transdermal product X-39. Key findings
are in changes of many amino acids levels, including glutamate, histamine, glycine, and
indicates distinct reduction of inflammation produced by the patch.
Of note the amino acids cysteine (cystine, an oxidized form of cysteine) glycine and
glutamate, which are building blocks of glutathione, and which showed a drop at level of
significance indicates biosynthesis glutathione in a trans-sulfuration pathway. Glutathione is

  - one of major antioxidant naturally produced in liver

  - facilitates metabolism of xenobiotics

  - decreases toxins by conjugation and excretion

  - prevents cellular damages by scavenging reactive oxygen species,
free radicals, and heavy metals

  - acts as neurotransmitter by modulating the NMDA receptors

  - induces GABA release, which is a major inhibitor of neurotransmitters
The changes in all aromatic amino acid levels show improved metabolic activity on dopamine
and serotonin pathways as well, and increase in level of epinephrine. More importantly, changes
in normetanephrine level gives clear indication of liver function change, specifically monoamine
oxidase (MOA) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme activity changes. Therefore
these enzymes are responsible for regulation of neurotransmitters. Tryptophan is a major
building block of serotonin, which is mood booster and healthy sleep producer in dim light.
Further changes in branched chain amino acids, along with alanine level change, indicate
glycine-histidine-lysine tripeptide (GHK) synthesis stimulation, and their positive impact on
copper containing enzyme activities, including alanine synthase and tyrosinase, cytochrome
oxidase.

Reduction in blood pressure and improved muscle relaxation are consistent changes which
are present in the physiology data.

**Discussion**

It is important to recognize that this was both a sample of convenience and a short-term pilot
study with a small sample size. However, there are several areas that showed significant
change, as well as a few that showed a clear trend towards change, though not quite to the
level of significance. It should also be noted that the shift in sleep is especially interesting, given
that the research subjects’ sleep was being interrupted every four hours for the saliva testing on
the days those questionnaires were administered. Therefore, the results may have been
stronger without this confounding variable.
The lack of shift in POM, which looks at overall mood, is also interesting. The patch itself was
not expected to shift the research subjects’ mood, but there was a possibility of this being a
secondary effect. Improved sleep and energy often also improve people’s mood.
There are several further key pieces of information in this data. The first is the improvement in
blood pressure. Further exploration of this parameter should be a priority, as phototherapy is a
non-invasive process, in contrast with the challenging side-effects caused by most blood
pressure medications, in a more vulnerable population of those who are aging. Reduction in
blood pressure would correlate with the aromatic amino acid findings which also would support
a GHK tripeptide increase and GHK copper binding peptide increase. This peptide development
does not only have antiSoxidant effect, it helps iron transmission while regulating cardiovascular
homeostasis. Further exploration and direct confirmation of tripeptide production should be
done.

The second is the impact of the over all improvement in amino acid production, stimulation of
enzyme activities, metabolism and overall bodies detoxifying ability. While amino acid
production and metabolism change on a daily basis and are strongly impacted by which foods
we eat and by our daily activities, the data taken over several days gives a snapshot of change.
Longer studies looking at stability of change should be considered. Key findings in the amino
acid production are increasing amino acids bioavailability, which are necessary building blocks
of protein and energy. The is an interactive process in which the body is engages where the
GHK tripeptide stimulates some amino acids production and metabolism, and the result is that
some of these amino acids act as inducers for biosynthesis of natural detoxifying agents like
glutathione. Glutathione is one of the major detoxifying agents our body produces and has
inhibiting effect on amyloid peptide oligomerization, which is well known cause of Alzheimer’s
disease. Glutathione is one of the liver’s main helpers along with cytochrome P450, by
conjugating toxins, and allowing free radicals to be excreted from the body.
The third interesting finding is that flexibility in gastrointestinal imbalance is restored. As one
ages there is often less flexibility in all the body systems. Flexibility is key in human survival. We
must be able to adapt, moment to moment, in order to survive. This patch triggers change in the
gut and may be determined in longitudinal studies to be restoring fitness with the body’s
adaptability to change.
The fourth interesting finding is in the changes to non-essential amino acid levels. Only
significant findings were listed in the tables. This indicates it is not only helping the gut
microbiome restore fitness and adaptability to change. It is reducing over all gut Inflammation,
as seen in the changes in cystine and glutathione production.
The fifth finding is the improved short-term memory within a week, which almost reached
significance (0.08). We have noted some aromatic amino acid level increase. These are the
major building blocks for dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Numerous
neurological disorders, Parkinson’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
Alzheimer’s disease are associated with dopamine and serotonin systems imbalances. By
stimulating amino acid production, the potential exists to delay the natural aging process,
improve the memory, and protect overall neuronal health. Further exploration in this area should
be done.
Longer studies, with larger numbers of subjects to explore the impact of this phototherapy
product should be considered.

**Summary**

This study provides information on the experience of participants’ metabolic and physiological
effects as a result of wearing the LifeWave X39 patch for 12 hours per day for a period of one
week. Study scope included questionnaires which were administered concurrently, covering a
range of previously reported anecdotal experiences with the X39 patches. Questionnaire data
demonstrated improvements in quality of sleep, memory, feelings of vitality, reduction of pain
and inflammation, and an overall sense of well-being.
The X39 patch showed clear, significant improvements in metabolic, blood pressure,
memory, sleep and other factors over the course of one week. These areas warrant study over
longer periods of time in future studies so that a better understanding of the comprehensive
nature and effects of the phototherapy produced by this patch may be demonstrated.
The data results of improvement in blood pressure, 17 statistically significant amino acid
changes over the 7 days, significant improvement in anti-inflammatory response, improvement
in sleep levels, reduction in blood pressure, improvement in short term memory, improvement in
reported feelings of vitality all suggest that further research with a larger sample size and over a
longer period of time is warranted to confirm this data and the previously reported anecdotal
responses in the testing of earlier subjects.

Since this study was done on an aging population it is also important to note that the patch
appears to support shifts toward fitness of the gut system and improved adaptability to change.
The human body must live in such a way that it can adapt and respond to change moment to
moment in order to survive. One of the first areas of the body which shows a reduction in
responsiveness to environmental change as we age, is the gut. While this study covered only a
one-week period, the effect in the data over the sampling period showed an improved response
promoting body fitness and adaptability to change on each subject. If one can change in healthy
ways in response to the environment, one can survive longer. Combined with the antiinflammatory response shown in this data, there is a potential for a positive impact on longevity.
Further longitudinal studies need to be undertaken to determine if these effects are maintained
or improved over time.
