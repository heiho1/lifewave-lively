**Abstract**


LifeWave, Inc. has developed a new patch called X-39 which is proposed to be a


phototherapy product that stimulates the skin with specific wavelengths of light for


the purpose of elevating the peptide GHK-Cu. The peptide GHK-Cu may


effectively stimulate the natural healing process in the body. LifeWave, Inc. has


developed X-39 patch with numerous intended benefits like improvement in overall


energy, rapid relief from pain and improvement in overall functional vitality of the


body. A pilot study was conducted with forty experimental and five control


voluntary subjects who were studied before and after wearing the LifeWave, Inc.


X-39 patch for a period of six weeks, using cutting edge non-invasive screening


technologies like biofield imaging, electro photonic imaging and electro-interstitial


screening. This set of devices allowed us to extract a broad spectrum of data ranging


from physical, energetic and emotional aspects of the body non-invasively and


efficiently. Statistical analysis of data revealed a highly significant increase

**Discussion**



Table.2 Results of the subjects in control group



The pilot study demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the subjects


biofield from using the LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patches in Bio-Well (EPI\GDV) and


Biofield Viewer (BV). The statistical analysis revealed a highly significant


improvement (p<0.0001) in overall energy of the person and significant


improvement(p<0.05) in the symmetrical distribution of energy over different


organs in bio-well (EPI\GDV). A significant improvement (p<0.05) of green pixels


in BV pixel analysis supports the effectiveness of the X-39 patches in terms of


improving the vitality of the biofield. Table. 1 displays summary post-test statistics


for the changes in the experimental group and reports the significance level. Table.


2 displays summary post-test statistics of the subjects in the control group have not


got a statistical significance.


From this research, we can conclude that LifeWave, Inc. X-39 patch is effective in


elevating the overall energetic vitality of the biofield and the body and also boosting


the self-healing mechanisms. This study reveals the potential of X-39 patches to


provide sustainable non-drug therapy. Several anecdotal responses were heard from


the subjects that the patches helped them to have an active day and sound sleep in


the night. Smart interventions are increasing in popularity, due to drug toxicity and


27


side effects. Patches can provide a sustainable complement to conventional


therapies. This study was conducted without a placebo patch. To advance this


science, future studies must be undertaken with a larger random sample using


double-blinded placebo controlled trials.


**Conclusion**


The pilot study demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the


experimental group when compared to the control group. It can be concluded that


X-39 patches are effective in bringing positive changes in the biofield and


improving the overall wellness of a person.
