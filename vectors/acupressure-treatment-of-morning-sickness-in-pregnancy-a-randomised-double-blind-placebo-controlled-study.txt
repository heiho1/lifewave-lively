Traditional Chinese acupuncture has for years been
presented as a useful antiemetic (1). The acupuncture
point most often used for antiemetic action is point 6
on the Pericardium channel according to traditional
Chinese medicine. The point is located on the fore-
arm, approximately 3 inches proximal to the distal
wrist crease between the tendons of the  exor carpi
radialis and palmaris longus muscles, about 1 cm
deep.
A recent review included 33 controlled trials con-
cerning acupuncture, acupressure or electrostimula-
tion
for
treatment
of
nausea
and:or
vomiting
associated with chemotherapy, surgery or pregnancy
(2).
Acupuncture
administered
under
anaesthesia
seemed to have no effect, but the reviewed papers
showed consistent results across different investiga-
tors, different groups of patients, and different forms
of acupuncture stimulation. A majority of them
showed
effect
of
acupuncture
on
nausea
and
vomiting.
Six of the studies in this review reported acupunc-
ture stimulation for morning sickness (3–8). The
methodological quality in these studies varied greatly,
as
some
were
non-randomised,
some
were
not
placebo-controlled, while most of them were based
on
small
samples.
All
but
one
study
favoured
acupuncture:acupressure over control. Aikins (9) car-
ried out a review of papers published in later years on
the same topic, concluding that acupressure was the
best studied alternative remedy that could afford
relief to many women. However, another paper on
acupressure for morning sickness with opposite re-
sults has recently been published (10). By improving
previous research models, we have performed a ran-
domised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study util-
ising acupressure in the treatment of nausea and
vomiting in early pregnancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants
Flyers inviting pregnant women to enter the study
were made available by all general practitioners and
pharmacies in the urban area of Tromsø municipal-
ity. A response was obtained from 139 pregnant
women. However, symptoms disappeared in 9 women
before randomisation, and 1 became too ill to partic-
ipate. Four other women were unable to travel to the
University Hospital, another 4 did not show up for
the agreed-upon interview, 3 miscarried before enter-
ing the study, and 2 withdrew after they had received
more detailed information about the study design. Of
the remaining 116 women, 19 were excluded because
they had gone beyond 12 weeks gestational age be-
fore entry. This study thus comprises 97 pregnant
women.
Study selection criteria were: 1) presence of nausea
for at least 1 week before trial entry, 2) no concomi-

tant diseases causing nausea and vomiting, 3) no
concomitant therapy for nausea at enrolment or dur-
ing the trial, and 4) no abnormalities discovered at
regular pregnancy follow-up. Gestational length was
estimated by the Naegeles method.
Methodology
The acupressure treatment was given by the use of a
wristband with a knob on the inside. Groups of 20
pregnant women were block-randomised in either an
active acupressure-wristband or a placebo wristband.
For each 20 patients, 10 were randomised to either
group.
From
the
outside,
the
placebo-wristband
looked identical to the acupressure-wristband. On the
inside, the placebo-wristband had a felt patch, while
the acupressure-wristband had a protruding button.
The button, made of plastic, was approximately 1 cm
in size, round in shape and protruded about 1 cm
below the inside of the wristband. There was no way
of adjusting the pressure of the wristband, which was
made of elastic material. The bands used in our study
were delivered free of charge by Sea Band UK Ltd,
through B&T Akupressur, Oslo, Norway.
In our pre-trial power calculations we chose a
signi cance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.8. We
assumed that 30% of those wearing placebo wrist-
bands would experience symptom alleviation and we
wanted to be able to detect a bene cial effect among
60% in the acupressure group. According to these
calculations, 100 participants should be enough to
signi cantly demonstrate a difference of this magni-
tude between use of the acupressure and placebo-
wristbands. Owing to expected drop-outs, we invited
139 pregnant women to participate (see previous
section). The investigators were blinded to the choice
of wristbands as a study assistant was hired to in-
struct the pregnant women. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participating women. The
study
was
approved
by
the
regional
Ethics
Committee.
Procedure
The study was carried out from January 1995 until
March 1996. Every pregnant woman participated for
12 days: a 4-day run-in, a 4-day intervention, and a
4-day follow-up period. Symptoms of nausea and
vomiting were recorded daily during this 12-day pe-
riod. Participants were asked to make three record-
ings of their
problems
every evening. The
 rst
registration was to determine what problems they had
had that particular day: 1¾no problems, 2¾nausea,
but no vomiting, and 3¾vomiting, but regardless of
how often and how many times they vomited. The
women were also asked to estimate how many hours
they had suffered each day. Finally, every evening the
women also  lled in a score of overall evaluation of
their symptoms on a visual analogue scale (VAS). A
self-composed non-graded VAS was used, with 0
indicating no problems and 5 indicating the worst
thinkable level of nausea and vomiting. The registra-
tion forms were returned by mail.
Thirteen women who did not complete all of the
daily registration forms during the study period were
assigned values equivalent to the last reported value
on the outcome variables. This was done to ensure
analysis according to the intention-to-treat princi-
ple.As part of the study entry interview, the partici-
pants were asked about previous pregnancies and
related problems (Table I).
In the intervention period, participants used wrist-
bands day and night on the ‘‘Neiguan’’ point of both
arms. The women were asked to take off the wrist-
band when they took a bath, or engaged in other
activities where the wristband could get wet.
At the end of the 12-day period, an evaluation
interview asked about possible problems the women
had encountered during the trial. They were also
asked what kind of wristband they thought they had
used, and whether they had continued to use the
wristband after the 12-day study period.
Statistics
Data from the  rst day of each period (run-in, inter-
vention and follow-up) were not included in the
analysis because of their transitional nature. All re-
sults were analysed with the use of Epi-Info software
(11). Two-sample t-tests for paired data and chi-
squared tests were used to compare the two groups.
RESULTS
In the active treated group, 71% of the women
reported less intensity of morning sickness while

using wristbands; the corresponding  gure for women
in the placebo group was 63%. Duration of symp-
toms, too, was reduced in both the active and placebo
groups, as an improvement was reported in 71% and
59%, respectively.
Figs. 1 and 2 show the mean intensity and duration
of morning sickness, respectively, for both groups
through the 12-day period. The mean difference be-
tween the last 3 days of the run-in period and the last
3 days of the active period is compared in Table II.
The hours of complaint had been more reduced in the
actively treated group than in the placebo-treated
group; 2.74 hours and 0.85 hours, respectively (p¾
0.018). In addition, there was a small non-signi cant
difference with regard to symptoms on the visual
analogue scale.
Based on the registration of daily symptoms, we
further analysed the results according to a 5 degree
grading of emetic symptoms similar to that in previ-
ous research: 1¾no problems (neither nausea nor
vomiting), 2¾slight (occasional nausea without vom-
iting), 3¾moderate (daily nausea without vomiting),
4¾troublesome (periodic nausea with vomiting), and
5¾severe (daily nausea with vomiting) (3,6). An
average improvement of 0.4–0.6 according to this 5
degree grading of emetic symptoms was obtained
among 43% in the active group and 41% in the
placebo group. However, there was no signi cant
difference between the two groups. At the end of the
follow-up period, 38% of those who had worn an
active band thought they had used an acupressure-
wristband, and 30% that they had used a placebo
device. In the placebo group, 7% thought they had
used an active wristband, and 59% thought they had
used the placebo device. Just one-third, 32% and
33%, respectively, did not know what type of wrist-
band they had used. There was no difference in terms
of continuous use of the wristband after the 12-day
study period between the two groups.
Sixty-three percent of participants in the active
group and 90% in the placebo group experienced
problems when using the wristband (p¾0.004). Pain,
numbness, soreness and hand-swelling were those
most often reported. No serious adverse effects were
mentioned, but three women (two with the acupres-
sure-wristband and one with the placebo-wristband)
said that they felt more sick during the study period.
DISCUSSION
Bias consideration
There are three possible sources of bias in our study:
selection, information and performance bias. Follow-
ing the annual number of births at the University
Hospital of Tromsø, about 1500 women became
pregnant during the study period. The prevalence of
morning sickness in early pregnancy has been esti-
mated at 75%. In other words, more than 1000
potentially eligible women could have suffered from
morning sickness during the study period.
The 97 participants in our study might thus be a
non-random subgroup among those with such prob-
lems. Some women might consider nausea and vomit-
ing as a normal part of pregnancy and therefore did
not give much attention to our study. Perhaps those
who volunteered also ‘‘believed in’’ alternative meth-
ods, and therefore do not represent the true ‘‘nausea
population’’. The women who entered the study
might also be those who suffered most from morning
sickness.
Even if the general prevalence of morning sickness
among pregnant women is less then 0.75%, our study
group would still be a selected subgroup. We hold
that this selection limits only the generalizability of
our results. Perhaps our selected women were the
‘‘worst’’ non-hospitalised cases, and therefore the re-
sults would only apply to this group.
Filling in forms is another possible source of bias.
The recording could be an invalid estimate of the real
experience of the women. If the participants were
truly blinded as to their treatment allocation, any loss
of validity in the data collected would dilute the
results, not change the main  ndings.
There is always a chance of performance bias in
intervention studies, especially when using therapy
administered by the patient herself. The instructor,
however, trained the patient carefully in placing the
wristband, with both groups being given the same
information and instruction. No patient recognised
the type of wristband they were given by the instruc-
tor, but participants in the control group guessed
better what type of band they had used. This could
have been either because they were simply better able
to detect their type of band or due to the lack of any
effect from it. There was no contact between partici-
pants in the study as long as it proceeded.
In previous studies, objections have been raised
about what should be considered as a true placebo.
Our placebo can be considered as the most equal
technique following the choice of study design. Fur-
ther, there has been a request for cross-over design
for these kinds of study. We claim that a cross-over
design would have biased the study more seriously, as
participating women could more readily have distin-
guished active from placebo treatment. We believe
that our methodology leaves little chance of perfor-
mance bias. Further, a natural decrease in symptoms
with increase in gestational age might have diluted
the effect if a cross-over design had been chosen.

Acupressure treatment of morning sickness in pregnancy

Effect of acupressure
We  nd it interesting that stimulating a certain point
on the forearm might reduce complaints from morn-
ing sickness. One could of course be sceptical to
acupuncture and acupressure and claim that any
physical stimulation of the body would give the same
result. However, our study was performed with the
idea that stimulation of certain points according to
traditional Chinese medicine is more effective that
stimulating random points or areas of the body.
We were unable to demonstrate the same degree of
symptom reduction by acupressure stimulation at
Pericardium 6, as in most previous studies (2). Thus,
the intensity of nausea measured by VAS was re-
duced in both groups. However, the proportion of
participants who experienced fewer symptoms was
larger in the acupressure-wristband group, and the
reduction was more pronounced.
The results were not statistically signi cant at the
5% level. Compared with Dundee (3) and De Aloysio
(6) in the 5 degree grading of emetic symptoms, our
study did not fully support their  ndings. Our ran-
domised, double-blind, placebo-controlled research
model differs from previous studies on acupressure
for morning sickness. Our methodology therefore
possibly leaves less chance of bias. A lack of suf cient
blinding and other problems in previous research
have been discussed in detail by O’Brian et al. (10).
Our study, on the other hand, showed that acu-
pressure might be effective in shortening the hours of
discomfort from morning sickness in early pregnancy.
Although there was a statistically signi cant reduc-
tion of duration of symptoms, the clinical relevance
might be discussed. One could say that reducing
sickness and discomfort from 9.7 hours to 7 hours
per day still leaves the patient with considerable
incapacity. However, every pregnant woman who
suffered fewer hours of emesis welcomed any small
improvement.
Conclusion
Our study could not support previous claims of a
substantial effect of acupressure on morning sickness.
The bene cial response in the placebo group shows
that any intervention against morning sickness may
be
effective.
However,
the
hours
of
discomfort
seemed to be reduced by wearing the acupressure
wristband, which might therefore be recommended
for morning sickness in early pregnancy, especially
before pharmaceutical prescriptions are considered.
