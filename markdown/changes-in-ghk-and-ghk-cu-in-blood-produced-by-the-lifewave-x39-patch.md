**Introduction**

This study explores the impact of wearing the Lifewave X39 patch over the


period of one week on levels of GHK and GHK-CU levels in the blood as a result. Blood


samples were taken at baseline, 24 hours and at 7 days of wearing the patch. A sample of


convenience of 10 subjects made up of both men and women aged 40-81 were selected to


participate in this study.


**Background**

The Lifewave X39 patch uses phototherapy to stimulates a rebalancing of the


body. Based on both observation and data from other studies, it was felt that a possible


change in the both the tripeptide GHK and the copper tripeptide GHK- Cu might be a


factor in the effects produced by the patch. The tripeptide has been demonstrated to


improve tissue remodeling. “It increases keratinocyte proliferation and normal collagen


synthesis, improves skin thickness, skin elasticity and firmness, improves wrinkles,


photodamage and uneven pigmentation, improves skin clarity, and tightens protective


barrier proteins.” (DeHaven, C., 2014) Research has identified that the peptide is used to


signal the beginning of the natural repair process.


**The Tripeptide**


“Copper tripeptide-1(GHK-Cu) is a small protein composed of the three amino


acids (protein building blocks) glycine, histidine, and lysine combined in a specific


geometric configuration with the physiologically beneficial mineral (copper)” (DeHaven,


C., 2014). This tripeptide was first isolated from human plasma albumin in 1973 by Dr.


Loren Pickart. Additional research has established the strong affinity the GHK peptide


has for copper, and exists in two forms, as this was not covered in the initial experiment.


These two forms are GHK and GHK-Cu. It is also important to mention that none of the


research around GHK has ever found it to cause an issue. (DeHaven, C., 2014)


**Non-transdermal Patch**


All X39 patches are sealed so that none of the substances in the patch actually


penetrate the skin. This allows for consistent patch promotion of the light flow


throughout the time the patch is worn. Patches are calibrated to support the flow of


infarred, near infared, and visible light frequencies in addition to ultraviolet light. Using


the same adhesives as band-aids, this limits the level of irritation which might be


developed through consistent daily use of the patch.


**Phototherapy**


Phototherapy in various forms have been used for over 100 years. In that time


there has been little evidence of negative side effects. There is a theoretical concern about


an increase in cancer rates, but “there was no significant association found with basal cell


carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma.” (Kakimoto, C., 2017) This suggests


that this is a relatively untapped option for healing with relatively few risks.


**Meridian Implications and Patch placement**


The Lifewave patches are placed on specific meridian points to maximize


effectiveness. The theory of balancing the body based on the Chinese meridian system is


over 3000 years old. Current information now maps the meridian system to parts of the


lymphatic system. The concept of the release of “Qi” on an area of the lymphatic system


is consistent with the evidence that the body has a variety of electrical-dermal potentials


across its surface (Becker & Selden, 1985, Flick, 2004) and that acupuncture points are


(at least in part) strategic conductors of electromagnetic signals (Feinstein, 2010).


There are two options for patch placement which have been defined for the X39


patch. The first is a point on the back, also known as GV14, Du-14, or Tao Dao. It is a


meeting point of the Governing vessel with all of the Yang meridians. This means that


point would have a "direct impact on the Yang meridians of the body" (Deadman, P.,


2001), and both generally Qi and Yang in the body.


The second is a point on the lower abdomen, also known as CV-6, Ren 6, or Qi


Hai. This point fosters Original Qi (Deadman, P., 2001). Between these two points most,


if not all, of the previously noted impacts in studies of the X39 patch are supported.


**Purpose**


This study focused on the impact of patch usage on GHK and GHK-CU levels in


the blood, with data taken at baseline, 24 hours and 7 days of patch placement. Half the


participants used the CV6 point and half using the GV14 point.


**Procedure**


Once human research studies ethics board approval was received (NFFEH *****)


recruitment was begun. Flyers advertising for interested research participants were posted


at various local sites. Participants would call into the main study phone number and were


assessed for inclusion and exclusion criterion. If appropriate they were scheduled for


consenting. At the time of arrival at the study site, each participant was consented.


Individual participants were then taken into the exam room and a blood sample


was taken using BD Vacutainer Safety Loc Blood Collection set with Pre-attached holder


sized 21GX0.75 or 23GX0.75 and placed in lavender top tubes. Each blood sample was


then placed in the centrifuge, spun for 10 minutes to separate the plasma, which was then


placed in the cryo tubes, and then flash frozen using dry ice. Samples were then placed in


2" thick polystyrene containers, wrapped in thermal box liners and placed in double


walled boxed for overnight shipping. Samples were sent to Axis Pharm's lab in San


Diego, CA.

**Results**

A sample of convenience of individuals consisted of 10 individuals. There were


four men and six women in the study which had a mean age of 64.2. Significant results


of the Lifewave X39 patch testing are as follows:


Table 1: Absolute changes from R1 (baseline) to R2 and R3

|Col1|Col2|N|Mean (SD)|Median (Range)|p-value|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|GCH concentration (ng/ml)|R2|10|9.5 (9.0)|6.9 (-3.4-27.5)|0.0098|
|GHC-CU concentration(ng/ml)|R3|10|4.2 (4.3)|4.0 (-2.6-11.5)|0.0137|



The blood analysis of GHK showed an increase at levels at a value of p< 0.0098 within


24 hours and GHK-CU also showed an increase at p<0.01 within 7 days.


**Discussion**

It is important to recognize that this was both a sample of convenience with a


small sample size and a pilot study. However, there was a significant change in the levels


of both GHK at 24 hours and GHK-CU in 7 days. This implies promotion of positive


benefits to the body. Further study will need to be done with larger sample sizes to


determine if there is a consistency of results over repeated trials.


**Conclusion**

This study explored the changes in amounts of GHK and GHK-CU present in the


blood as a result of wearing the Lifewave X39 patch for 1 week. There was a significant


increase in GHK in the blood which was seen at 24 hours, at the level of p<0.0098. A


significant increase in GHK-CU in the blood was also seen at 7 days at the level of


p<0.0137.
