**Abstract**

_**Purpose**_ - To determine if the LifeWave X39 non-transdermal patch can produce changes in tripeptides
GHK and GHK-Cu production.
_**Materials**_ - BD Vacutainer Safety Loc Blood Collection sets with Pre-attached holder sized 21GX0.75 or
23GX0.75, lavender top tubes, KendroSorvallBiofuge Centrifuge 75005184+, sterile eye droppers,
polystyrene containers, thermal liners and an AB Sciex API4000 Qtrap. Analysis software included:
Qtrap Analyst software 1.6.2. and R software version 3.5.1.
_**Method**_ - Blood was drawn into lavender top tubes on day 1, 2 and 7 with blood collection sets and
spun in KendroSorvall centrifuge for 10 minutes at1300rcf at room temperature. The plasma was
placed in cryo tubes and flash frozen using dryice, then shipped to the laboratory for analysis. Once
there the blood samples were processed according to the original thesis of Dr. Pickard. The filtrate was
concentrated by speed-vac and reconstituted with de-ionized water to50µland analyzed with AB Sciex
API4000 Qtrap. The data was analyzed with Analyst software 1.6.2. Results were then sent for
statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. All reported p-values are two-sided and p(ng/ml)|24 hours|10|9.5 (9.0)|6.9 (-3.4-27.5)|0.0098|
|GHK-Cu concentration(ng/ml)|Day 7|10|4.2 (4.3)|4.0 (-2.6-11.5)|0.0137|



The blood analysis of GHK showed an increase at levels at p< 0.0098 within 24 hours and GHK-Cu
also showed an increase at p<0.01 at 7 days.

**Discussion**

It is important to recognize that this was both a sample of convenience with a small sample size in a
pilot study. However, there was a significant change in the levels of both GHK at 24 hours and GHK-Cu
in 7 days. This implies promotion of positive benefits to the body. Further study will need to be done
with larger sample sizes and control groups to determine if there is a consistency of results over
repeated trials and statistically significant changes when compared with a control group.

**Conclusion**

This pilot study explored the changes in amounts of GHK and GHK-Cu present in the blood as a result
of wearing the LifeWave X39 patch for 1 week. There was a significant increase in GHK in the
blood,seen at 24 hours, at the level of p<0.0098. A significant increase in GHK-Cu in the blood was
also seen at 7 days, at the level of p<0.0137.
