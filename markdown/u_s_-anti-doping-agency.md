Dear Mr. Marculescu and Mr. Wielgus,

As you may know, in mid-June 2004, the United States Anti-Doping Agency
("USADA") was informed that certain swimmers associated with the women's
swimming program at Stanford were wearing "patches" during practice and
competition. USADA was also informed that some of these "patches" had been
tested by a private laboratory and allegedly showed the presence of a prohibited
substance. As you know, USADA was requested to look into the information
provided to it concerning these "patches."


First, upon initially learning that swimmers were using these patches, which were
alleged to contain prohibited substances, USADA conducted targeted, out-ofcompetition, no-notice testing on athletes associated with the Stanford women's
program. USADA tested several athletes believed to be wearing the patches and
they tested negative. Additionally, these athletes were also subject to regular incompetition testing and none of the swimmers have tested positive.

Additionally, USADA was provided two separate sets of patches. USADA
forwarded these patches for testing to the World Anti-Doping Agency ("WADA")
accredited laboratory at the University of California at Los Angeles ("UCLA
Laboratory ["] ). The first set of "patches" received by USADA apparently came from
the same set as those that the swimmers were wearing at the 2004 U.S. Olympic
Trials. The second set received by USADA was from the set of patches collected
from the swimmers in early April 2004. USADA has no independent evidence that
the patches came from any other source than as reported to it. 1

The UCLA Laboratory conducted a thorough scientific analysis on both sets of
patches. The UCLA Laboratory analysis utilized gaschromatography/massspectrometry methods which are among the most sophisticated and sensitive in
the detection of prohibited substances. The UCLA Laboratory reports that none of
the patches, which it received from USADA, contained any substance on the
prohibited list. Importantly, these test results are necessarily limited to only the
patches tested and should not be interpreted to suggest that any other patches
are free of prohibited substances.

Lastly, USADA has been in contact with the private laboratory which supposedly
tested patches provided to it by a third party. This laboratory, after conducting an
internal search, has no record of performing testing on any patches and states
unequivocally that it does not perform this type of testing. We have received and
analyzed a fax cover sheet and a typed, unsigned paragraph reporting to be the
test results of the patches performed by this private laboratory. The private
laboratory which supposedly generated this report and fax cover sheet denies that
the report and the fax cover sheet originated at its laboratory.2 USADA has been
unable, despite repeated efforts to fully identify or contact the third party who
supposedly provided the patches directly to this private laboratory.

At this time, following extensive information gathering including target testing,
independent laboratory analysis and investigating the alleged positive laboratory
report, USADA does not have any credible information to support that the patches
provided to it contain any prohibited substances. Likewise, USADA has no
credible evidence to believe that the use of the patches by the swimmers
associated with the Stanford women's swimming program was a violation of any
anti-doping rules.

Importantly, USADA warns all athletes, including your swimmers, that they are
strictly responsible for everything that goes into their body by whatever means.
USADA encourages TINA and USAS to continue to take affirmative steps to
ensure that your swimmers are adequately warned of the dangers of
supplements. As you know, all products in the US, falling under the Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act ("DSHEA") including vitamins, minerals, herbs,
amino. Acids, and other supplements regardless of their form or administration (powder,


liquid, cream, transdermal administration) are not adequately regulated and often
domain unlisted prohibited substances which may result in doping violations.

If you have any questions or concern, please feel free to contact me.

Travis T. Tygart Director of Legal Affairs

1 None of the patches received by USADA had any identifying marks, packaging, or brand names
on them.
2 The fax cover sheet and letterhead of the private laboratory is not the same as that or the
alleged test result.
