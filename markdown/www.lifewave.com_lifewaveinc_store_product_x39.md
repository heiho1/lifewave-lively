FAQs


Phototherapy


![](https://www.lifewave.com/Content/cms/public/assets/svg/line-divider.svg)

What is Phototherapy?

The science of phototherapy, which has been around for about 100 years, uses light to improve the health of the body. As far back as two thousand years ago, the ancient Greeks had a center for studying the effects of different colored lights on the body. Even the ancient Egyptians, who promoted health by focusing sunlight through colored glass on certain areas of the body, understood this concept.

![](https://www.lifewave.com/Content/cms/public/assets/svg/line-divider.svg)

How do our Phototherapy Patches Work?

Your body emits heat, including heat in the infrared spectrum.

Our patches are designed to trap this infrared energy when placed on the body, which causes them to reflect it back to stimulate specific points on the skin that can promote a general state of health and healthy activity unique to each LifeWave patch.

![](https://www.lifewave.com/Content/cms/public/assets/svg/line-divider.svg)

What makes one LifeWave patch different than another?

Each patch is exclusively designed to reflect particular wavelengths of energy that stimulate specific points on the skin. This enables each patch to provide unique wellness benefits to the user. No drugs or stimulants enter your body.
