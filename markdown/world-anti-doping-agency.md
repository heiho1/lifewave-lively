Dear Dr Haltiwanger,

I would like to inform you that the WADA List Committee reviewed the information
pertaining to the LifeWave patch technology. Based on the information reviewed,
including the patch testing conducted by USADA, the Committee considers that this
technology is not a method falling under the WADA List of Prohibited Substances and
Methods.

This statement by no means constitutes a WADA endorsement of the LifeWave
Technology. WADA continues to draw the attention of the athletes to their strict
responsibility for everything they absorb or apply to their body. This in no way
constitutes an authorization for LifeWave to advertise or indicate on its product or
advertisement that this product is authorized by WADA.

I trust this information is helpful.

Yours sincerely,

Olivier Rabin.
