|L.I.-4 and the Pericardium channel (from wrapping the<br>middle finger) always have more stimulation than others.<br>Also, wrist points including Taiyuan LU-9 and Shenmen<br>HE-7 receive stronger pressure compared to the other points<br>on the body of the forearm. Thus a more honed formula of<br>the more significant points is as follows:<br>_Chassidic_: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen<br>HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium<br>channel.<br>_Ashkenazi_: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen<br>HE-7, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium channel.<br>_Sefard_: Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen<br>HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium<br>channel.<br>_Sefardim_:Tianfu LU-3, Fengfu DU-16, Lieque LU-7, Shenmen<br>HE-7, Taiyuan LU-9, Houxi SI-3, Hegu L.I.-4, Pericardium<br>channel.<br>Note that there is essential agreement and overlap be-<br>tween the honed point prescriptions called for by the four<br>different tefillin wrapping techniques. The only difference<br>is that the the Ashkenazi style excludes Taiyuan LU-9. This<br>should have little clinical significance, given the scope of<br>the remaining points in the formula.<br>**_Point and channel discussion_**<br>• The Governing Vessel (Du Mai) is an extra-ordinary<br>meridian that runs up the spine and penetrates the brain. It<br>is well known for its ability to treat psychiatric disorders<br>and influence the mind8. The Spiritual action of points on<br>the Governing vessel can be explained because it has the<br>closest relationship with the brain, which, according to pre-<br>Inner Classic and later Daoist traditions is considered to be<br>the seat of the spirit. A further connection of the Governing<br>Vessel to Spirit is found from its anterior pathway, which<br>directly connects it to the more traditional home of Spirit,<br>the Heart.<br>• _Fengfu DU-16_(Wind Mansion) is also known as Gui Zhen,<br>which translates as Ghost Pillow9. It has also a point in the<br>Window of Heaven category10. According to channel theory,<br>Fengfu DU-16 is where the Governing vessel penetrates the<br>brain. It is one of two points (the other being Baihui DU-20)<br>that directly nurture the brain and spinal cord. The thera-<br>peutic scope of Fengfu DU-16 is quite wide and it is known<br>to strongly benefit both concentration and memory. It also<br>treats dizziness, stroke, aphasia and headache. In psychotic<br>patients, it reduces the desire for suicide and for self-<br>mutilation. Fengfu DU-16 is also is a point on Yang Linking<br>vessel that connects all heavenly rising Yang energy.<br>• _Shangxing DU-23_ (Upper Star) is also known as Gui Tang<br>which translates as Ghost Hall. It treats psychosis, head-<br>aches, and nearsightedness. It is also the root of the sinus<br>and is very effective in treating loss of smell. Since the<br>olfactory nerve is the first of the 12 cranial nerves, its use in<br>this manner clearly indicates a profound effect on the brain.<br>• _Shenting DU-24_ (Spirit Court) is also known as Tianting<br>(Courtyard of Heaven) calms the mind and balances the<br>spirit. It can be used to treat any mental disease11. Like other<br>points of the Governing vessel, it has a strong action on<br>calming the spirit and treating epilepsy and other mania<br>disorders. According to Daoist tradition, this point can<br>connect directly to Niwan (Mud Ball), which is considered<br>to be the location of the physical basis of the spirit. “The qi<br>of the Heart is connected with the Niwan Palace above.”12<br>The significance of Niwan, also known as Huangting (Yel-<br>low Courtyard) is emphasized in the_Classic on the Central_<br>_Void in the Inner Sphere_ which said, “The origin of essence-<br>spirit in the brain is also called Niwan” and also “The entire<br>spirit that expresses in the face has its origin in Niwan”.13<br>• _Houxi SI-3 (Back Ravine)_ is the most important point on the<br>hand with respect to the mind because it is the opening<br>point to the Governing vessel. It frees and moves qi in the<br>Governing vessel and acts as a multiplier that strengthens<br>the actions of the vessel’s points (Fengfu DU-16, Shangxing<br>DU-23 and Shenting DU-24) already stimulated by the head<br>tefillin. Alone or in combination with other points, it clears<br>the spirit, treats any kind of psychosis including loss of<br>memory, dementia, sorrow or fear.<br>• _Zhizheng SI-7_(Branch of the Upright) is the luo connecting<br>point of the Small Intestine channel, connecting to the Heart<br>channel. It has a pronounced effect on regulating and<br>calming the shen. It helps relieve anxiety, fear and sorrow.<br>• _Hegu L.I.-4_ (Union Valley) is the command point of the<br>head and face. It is used to treat all conditions of the head,<br>face, sinuses or eyes. It has a powerful calming and anti-<br>spasmodic effect and is widely used in relieving pain. It has<br>a strong influence on the mind and has the ability to soothe<br>the mind and calm anxieties.
