Introduction


Bioluminescence, which is weak but visible, is sometimes
produced in living organisms, such as fireflies or jellyfish, as the
result of specialized enzymatic reactions that require adenosine
triphosphate. However, virtually all living organisms emit
extremely weak light, spontaneously without external photoexcitation [1]. This biophoton emission is categorized in different
phenomena of light emission from bioluminescence, and is
believed to be a by-product of biochemical reactions in which
excited molecules are produced from bioenergetic processes that
involves active oxygen species [1,2]. Human body is glimmering
with light of intensity weaker than 1/1000 times the sensitivity of
naked eyes [3,4]. By using a sensitive charge-coupled-device
(CCD) camera with the ability to detect light at the level of a single
photon, we succeeded in imaging the spontaneous photon
emission from human bodies [3].
Previously, for obtaining an image, it took more than 1 hour of
acquisition, which is practically impossible for the analysis of
physiologically relevant biophoton emission. By improving the
CCD camera and lens system, here we have succeeded in
obtaining clear images using a short exposure time, comparable
with the analysis of physiological phenomena. Since metabolic
rates are known to change in a circadian fashion [5,6], we
investigated the temporal variations of biophoton emission across
the day from healthy human body.


Results and Discussion


u
A cooled CCD camera operated at 2120 C with slow scanning
mode read-out was used with a specially designed high-throughput
lens system. The camera was placed in a light-tight room in
complete darkness (schematic illustration of the experimental setup
is shown in Fig. 1A). Five healthy male volunteers, in their 209s,



were subjected to normal light-dark conditions and allowed to
sleep from 0:00–7:00. On the days of photon imaging, volunteers
were kept in a room (400 lux) adjacent to the dark room. For
imaging purposes, the body surface was wiped and the subject was
left 15 minutes in the dark room for dark adaptation, after which
the naked subject in sitting position was exposed for 20 minutes to
the CCD camera. Measurements were carried out in every
3 hours from 10:00 to 22:00 and continued for 3 days. Just before
and after the measurements, the surface body (thermography) and
oral temperature were taken. Saliva was also collected after the
photon measurements for the analysis of cortisol level as a
biomarker of endogenous circadian rhythms. Temporal variation
of photon emission intensity was calculated from image data with
extraction of the face and body intensity.
The daily variation of photon emission is shown in Fig. 1B–G.
In all images, photon emission intensity from the face was higher
than from the body. Moreover, photon emission intensity from the
face was not homogeneous: the central area around the mouth and
the cheeks was higher than the lateral area and the orbits.
Furthermore, the photon emission intensity on the face and upper
body appeared to display time-dependent changes. We plotted
total photon emission intensity over the body and face against
time, averaged across the 5 volunteers (Fig. 1H). Photon emission
was weak in the morning, increased in the afternoon and peaked
in the late afternoon (ca 16:00) (one way ANOVA, F 4,74 = 4.10,
P,0.005). These data strongly suggest that there is a diurnal
rhythm of photon emission from the human body. To further
support this conclusion, immediately following the end of the
previous experiment three volunteers were kept awake in a light
(400 lux) environment and photon emission was measured at 1:00,
4:00 and 7:00 AM (Supplementary Figure S1). Photon emission
formed a peak at late afternoon, then gradually decreased and
stayed low at 1:00–7:00 AM in a constantly exposed light

condition (400 lux), indicating the diurnal rhythm of photon might
be caused by endogenous circadian mechanism.
Ultraweak biophoton emission was completely different from
thermographic images showing surface temperature (Fig.1I). High
photon emission were detected from the cheeks, followed by the
upper neck and the forehead, while high temperature was detected in
the supraclavicular lateral neck region, from which photon emission
was low. In cheek, the highest level of emission reaches to 3000
photon/s?cm [2] at 16:00 which is about double to the value at 10:00.
Next, we examined the correlation of photon emission to other
physiological parameters known to show circadian variations. In
the subject of Fig.1B–G, we found a temporal decrease of cortisol
from morning to evening, in opposite to the increase of photon
emission (Fig. 2A). Cortisol concentration shows a clear daily
rhythm, peaking in the morning and negatively correlated with
photon emission intensity (p,0.002; from 5 volunteers; Fig. 2B).
Body temperature, another parameter showing daily rhythms
peaking at night, does not show significant correlation with photon
emission (Supplementary Figure S2).
The photon emission mechanism is thought to originate from
the generation of free radicals in energy metabolic processes. The
spectra of photon emission detected from the palm skin span from
500 to 700 nm, with primary and secondary emission peaks at
630–670 nm and 520–580 nm, respectively [7]. Free radicals
subsequently react with lipid or protein, generating electronically
excited species as byproducts [1]. These excited molecules, such as
carbonyl group in excited triplet state from lipid peroxidation or
proteins including excited tyrosine or tryptophan, can further react
with fluorophores through energy transfer and lead to photon
emission [8,9]. Higher level photon emission on facial skin might
be caused by differences in the content of melanin fluorophores

[10] between facial and thoracic skin.
No significant correlation of daily photon intensity and
temperature was found, and the dissimilarity between photon
emission and thermal image suggest that the diurnal rhythm of
photon emission is not a consequence of a change of temperature
or microcirculation. Moreover, a clear negative correlation of
temporal changes of photon emission and cortisol might suggest
that the diurnal rhythm of photon emission reflects the changes of

cellular metabolic processes under the control of the circadian
clock. Circadian rhythms are generated in most cells throughout
the body, driven by clock genes interlocked in transcription/
translation feedback loops [11,12]. Recent advances of chronobiology have revealed that the redox state of the cells regulates
circadian gene expression, indicating the importance of metabolic
cues for clock oscillations [6,13,14]. Indeed, glucose utilization,
accompanied by oxygen consumption, shows robust rhythms in
the main mammalian circadian center [5]. By the regulation of
cellular respiratory chain producing reactive oxygen species, which
in turns react with molecules including proteins, lipids and
fluorophores, whose excited states emit biophotons [1,8,9,10], the
human body glitters to the rhythm of the circadian clock.


Materials and Methods


CCD camera system
Spectral Instruments 600 series CCD camera system (Spectral
Instruments, Inc., AZ, USA) was used. Mounted CCD42-40 (e2v
technologies Ltd., Essex, UK), which is a back-illuminated, fullframe operation CCD with a 204862048 pixel resolution and
13.5613.5 m m pixel size. The camera system is equipped with a

u
cooling head to maintain the CCD at 2120 C using a closed-cycle
mechanical cryogenic unit. Under these conditions, quantum
efficiency is 75% at the peak wavelength. Dark current is 0.65
electron/pixel/h and readout noise in the slow scanning mode is
less than 4.5 electron rms. The CCD camera head has a specially
designed lens system, which is designed to maximize the light
collection efficiency (numerical aperture (NA) of the lens system on
the detector side is 0.5 and the number of lenses is restricted 7

pieces). Magnification of the lens system is 1/20 and the light
collection efficiency to the surface of the subject is 1.0610 [2][3] . In
this experiment, the CCD was operated in the 868 binning mode,
and the actual pixel number was 2566256. Taking into account
the detection limit, which is determined by dark current and
readout noise of the CCD, as well as light collection efficiency, the
minimum detectable number of photons on each pixel is estimated
ca 100 photon/s/cm [2] on the surface of the subject under the
measurement condition.

Measurement procedure
All study participants were healthy males in their 209s without
any skin diseases or oral medications. The average time of sleep
onset was 23:30 hours (range, 23:00 to 01:00 hours) and that for
awakening was 06:15 hours (range, 06:00 to 07:00 hours). No
attempt was made to synchronize the sleeping habits of the study
participants before the study. From one week before the
experiments, subjects were under controlled conditions to
maintain regular sleeping hours. Subjects were not allowed to
use cosmetics including aftershave lotion. Volunteers had lunch at
12:30 hours and dinner at 18:30 hours. Snacks and cold drinks
were allowed between meals, at the study participant’s discretion.
During body imaging, participants were naked from the waist up.
After a slight wipe of the body with lukewarm water, one by one
the subjects were invited in the darkroom and where a relax chair
was provided. Before photon emission measurements, the subjects
were left 15 minutes in the darkroom for dark adaptation. During
the dark adaptation, a thermograph to check the surface
temperature of the body and a picture of the subject under weak
light illumination for focusing are taken. Biophoton emission
measurements are taken continuously for 20 minutes by the CCD
camera. During measurements, comfortable music was provided
for relaxation but sleep was not allowed. At the end of the
measurements, thermograph and picture under weak illumination
are taken again, together with the oral temperature. Photon
emission intensity from the face and upper body was calculated
from imaging data. Salivary cortisol levels were measured by
radioimmunoassay. For statistical analysis, one-way ANOVAs
followed by Bonferroni/Dunn’s multiple comparisons were
