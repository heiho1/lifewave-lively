**Abstract**


**Purpose:** To determine if the LifeWave X39 non-transdermal photobiomodulation active patch would show improved production of GHK-Cu over

controls in a double blind randomized controlled trial.


**Materials:** BD Vacutainer Safety Loc Blood Collection sets with Pre-attached holder sized 21GX0.75 or 23GX0.75 and lavender top tubes. Kendro Sorvall
Biofuge Centrifuge 75005184+ and AB Sciex API4000 Qtrap. Analysis software included: Qtrap Analyst software 1.6.2 and R software version 3.5.1.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.1; http://www.r-project.org/).


**Method:** Sixty people age 40-80 were computer randomized into two groups. One lavender top tube was drawn and then spun in Kendro Sorvall
centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1300 rcf. The plasma was placed in cryo tubes and flash frozen to -22C then shipped in dry ice to laboratory for analysis. The
filtrate was concentrated by speed-vac and reconstituted with de-ionized water to 50 ul and analyzed with AB Sciex API4000 Qtrap. Statistical assessments
were evaluated using a nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test, p values are two-sided and pN=30|Col4|Active GroupN=28|Col6|
