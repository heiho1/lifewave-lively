# Auricular Acupressure for Weight Reduction in Obese Asian Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial


Ching Hsiu Hsieh, BSN


**ABSTRACT**


**Background:** Treatment options for obesity include calorie reduction, increased activity, behavior modification, pharmacotherapy, and surgery. Alternative options such as ear acupuncture may be effective adjunct ther
apy.
**Objective:** To test the efficacy of auricular acupressure for weight reduction in overweight and obese young
adults.

**Design, Setting, and Participants:** An 8-week randomized controlled trial of 55 young Asian adults (18–20
years) with a body mass index (BMI) of 23 or higher (the cutpoint for overweight in Asians set by the World
Health Organization).
**Intervention:** All participants met once weekly for 10 minutes. Ear acupressure treatment was administered
weekly for 8 weeks (10 minutes per session): the control group had adhesive tape placed on the ear acupoints
only while the experimental group had Japanese Magnetic Pearls placed on the ear acupoints using adhesive
tape to hold them in place.
**Main Outcome Measure:** Change in BMI from baseline to trial completion.
**Results:** Control group BMI increased significantly from baseline by 0.05 ( _P_ � .001) and the acupressure group
BMI decreased significantly from baseline by 0.70 ( _P_ � .001).
**Conclusion:** Auricular acupressure using Japanese Magnetic Pearls could be used to decrease BMI in young
adults.

**INTRODUCTION**


According to an NHANES study (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), overweight adolescents have a
70% chance of becoming overweight or obese adults. If one
or both parents are overweight or obese, this risk increases to
80%. [1] To prevent obesity, strategies should target young
adults. Special prevention strategies might focus on ethnic
groups at highest risk for becoming obese by their mid-30s. [2]

Obesity is becoming more prevalent globally. It remains

a major critical public health problem in industrialized countries [3] because of its association with multiple chronic disorders, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus, gallbladder
disease, osteoarthritis, some cancers, and increased mortality. [2–5] Also, the prevalence of social problems among obese
adolescents is quite high, and these social problems are predictive of both short-term and long-term psychological outcomes. [6]


Overweight and obesity are identified according to the

classification adopted by the World Health Organization
(WHO). Body mass index (BMI, measured as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is widely used
among adults as a measure of adiposity, with a BMI greater
than 25 being indicative of overweight and a BMI greater
than 30 being indicative of obesity. [7,8] However, a WHO
consultation on BMI for Asian populations (which met in
Singapore in 2002) focused exclusively on issues related to
overweight and obesity. The WHO suggested Asian populations use BMI greater than 23 to define overweight and
BMI greater than 27.5 to define obesity. In this article, BMI
is classified according to those criteria. [8,9]

In the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), practitioners believe that acupuncture works to modify central
nervous system neurotransmitter levels by stimulating acupoints. [10,11] Auricular acupuncture therapy has been used
worldwide to treat addiction. [11–15] The points in the human
body where acupuncture can be applied are the channels that
the spirit passes through and are the acupuncture sites. [16] The
veins and arteries of the ear connect the internal organs of
the whole body. [17,18]

Auricular acupuncture therapy is the method most often
used for the treatment of obesity. [19] Research shows that the
most common acupuncture points for treating obesity are
Shenmen, Mouth, Stomach, Endocrine points, and Small intestine. Stimulating the Shenmen point can lead participants
to become calmer and can lead to sedation. Auricular of

Mouth point can reduce the strong angry feeling and treat
oral ulcer. The Stomach and Endocrine on the ear point can
restrain appetite and eliminate the feeling of hunger (satiety
and fullness), and then achieve the effect of losing
weight. [3,5,16–23] The Small Intestine point can treat dyspepsia and then achieve the effect of losing weight. [17]

This study was a randomized controlled trial designed to
test the effectiveness of auricular acupressure interventions
(Japanese Magnetic Pearl on a small adhesive tape) for



weight reduction in Asian young adults with a BMI of 23

or greater.


**METHODS**


**Demographics and Study Design**


This study used a randomized design including a control
group and experimental. The sample consisted of 70 participants who were between 18 and 20 years old.
Ethics approval was obtained from the Yuan-Pei University Human Research Ethics Committee and informed
consent was obtained from each participant prior to study
enrollment.


**Intervention**


Participants were then randomly placed into 1 of 2
groups. Both groups received health education regarding
consuming a reduced-calorie diet, increasing activity levels, and making lifestyle modifications. The control group
received a small adhesive only on the acupoints. The experimental group had added Japanese Magnetic Pearl for
acupressure on the acupoints. The points for treating obesity on the ear are Shenmen, Mouth, Stomach, Endocrine
points, and Small Intestine. The weight-reduction program
extended over 8 weeks. All participants met once weekly
for 10 minutes. Body mass index (BMI) was measured each
week.


**Statistical Analysis**


Data were analyzed using the SPSS General Linear MixEffect Model (GLMM) guided variables inferences at individual levels and appropriated for continuous outcomes

(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). For estimates of dependent variable, each group and each time (week) were also repeated
for significance; _P_ � .05 was set a priori as the threshold
for significance.


**RESULTS**


After 8 weeks of auricular therapy, the total sample of
this study had 55 participants: 15 withdrew for a variety of
reasons and are not included in the final analysis. There were
28 participants in the control group and 27 in the acupressure group. The breakdown of study participants by gender
is as follows: 26/28 women in the control group and 24/27
women in the acupressure group (women comprised 91% of
the sample).
After 8 weeks of ear acupressure treatment, BMI increased
significantly in the control group by 0.05 ( _P_ � .001). This
indicated that continuous ear acupressure treatment with adhesive only on the acupoints could not decrease BMI after
8 weeks (Table 1).
In the experimental group, BMI decreased significantly
by 0.7 ( _P_ � .001). There was a nearly statistically significant BMI result in the second week, which indicated that
participants who received continuous ear acupressure treatment with Japanese Magnetic Pearl could decrease BMI.
However, there were many statistically nonsignificant BMI
results in the third through seventh weeks (Table 1).


**DISCUSSION**


The present study results showed that after 8 weeks of
ear acupressure treatment by Japanese Magnetic Pearls, the
average BMI decreased significantly. Other studies support
this finding. For example, in a 4-week ear acupuncture study,
the mean (SD) weight loss was 4.0 (1.4) kg ( _P_ � .05) in
the treatment group. [23] In a study of 21 obese patients using
various auricular points for treatment periods ranging from
2–6 weeks, mean (SD) weight loss was 3.3 (1.9) kg (range,
1–7.3 kg). [18]


**CONCLUSIONS**


Reduction of body weight and decreasing the prevalence
of obesity is an important and urgent issue. [24] This study’s
sample size is similar to that in previous research, which
reached similar conclusions. One limitation is that participants were predominantly female. Thus, future work should
work to balance participants’ sex, with further studies involving much large groups.
In this study, auricular acupressure using Japanese Magnetic Pearls decreased BMI after 8 weeks. However, there



was no statistically significant result from the first through
seventh weeks. Therefore, long-term treatment and followup are also necessary for further study.
